<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Apex is a self-service API platform that acts as a centralised and secure API
    gateway for the Government. On Apex, users can easily publish, secure,
    monitor, and discovery APIs.</p>
<p>With APEX, data collected and stored by one agency can be used by numerous
    other approved agencies or businesses to improve and streamline their own
    processes. For example, MyInfo leverages the capabilities of APEX to enable
    citizens and residents to manage the use of their personal data for a myriad
    of online transactions, including applying for a Housing Development Board
    flat and opening a bank account. The MyInfo API for developers makes it
    possible for more applications to be integrated with MyInfo without
    significant hassle or overhead costs.</p><iframe
