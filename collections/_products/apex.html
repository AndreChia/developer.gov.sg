<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Because software rarely functions in isolation, it is also important to pay
    attention to securing the data exchanged among applications. Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs)—coded rules and tools for building
    software—can be used to manage who has access to data and how data gets
    transferred. Implemented correctly, APIs allow the seamless transmission of
    information across multiple parties, whether they be different individuals
    or organisations.</p>
<p>Hence, GovTech has created a centralised government-wide API
    exchange—APEX—that serves as a searchable library of APIs. Authentication
    protocols on APEX ensure that only authorised applications have access to
    highly confidential citizen data. At the same time, activities on the APEX
    platform are tractable as the system audits and logs the applications that
    have requested to pull data from government databases.</p>
<p>With APEX, data collected and stored by one agency can be used by numerous
    other approved agencies or businesses to improve and streamline their own
    processes. For example, MyInfo leverages the capabilities of APEX to enable
    citizens and residents to manage the use of their personal data for a myriad
    of online transactions, including applying for a Housing Development Board
    flat and opening a bank account. The MyInfo API for developers makes it
    possible for more applications to be integrated with MyInfo without
    significant hassle or overhead costs.</p><iframe
