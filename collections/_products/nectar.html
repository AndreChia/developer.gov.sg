description: Simplifies and speeds up the deployment of digital services for government agencies in a secure environment

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>For government agencies to get the benefits of cloud hosting, the on-premise virtualisation solutions needed to evolve to the next level of platform — Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which supports cloud-native application design. Containers and APIs became an obvious choice in developing such a platform.</p>
<p>The GDS team at GovTech undertook the development of an on-premise Platform-as-a-service (codenamed Nectar) to bring some of the benefits of Cloud to its users across government agencies.</p>
<p>Nectar stands for Next-Generation Container Architecture and is the name given to the Platform-as-a-Service built for Singapore government. It simplifies and speeds up the deployment of digital services for government agencies.</p>

<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>Here are some of the key driving motivations for the platform.</p>
<h6>Agility</h6>
<p>The platform must have the flexibility required by modern applications in terms of speed and frequency of deployments. It needs to support continuous delivery and automation.</p>
<br>
<h6>Robustness and Security</h6>
<p>The platform should improve the security of our applications by automating the processes and integrating security tools while providing dynamic scalability and high performance.</p>
<br>
<h6>Openness and Portability</h6>
<p>At the onset, we were looking to adopt open-source technologies to prevent lock-in to proprietary software and achieve flexibility of portability to new platforms.</p>
<hr>
<h4>How Nectar works</h4>
<p>The Nectar platform was designed to integrate the complete delivery pipeline pulling the code from source-code repositories, performing the builds, running security scans, deploying the application, scaling on demand and monitoring.</p>
<h6>Containerised Application Delivery</h6>
<p>Docker container packaging provided a clean yet powerful way of delivering application packages to the platform. The container packages contain everything the application requires to run.</p>
<p>For orchestration of containers, we use openshift which is based on Kubernetes and commercially supported by redhat.</p>
<br>
<h6>Self-Service Provisioning and Deployment</h6>
<p>The Nectar portal provides a simple user interface with all the information needed for designing cloud-native apps, so that users can self-serve. Self-service capabilities reduce operational needs and manual errors. It also improved turn-around times for setting up new deployments significantly.</p>
<p>Once logged in, users can provision new services dynamically and allocate CPU and memory to their container services as required.</p>
<br>
<h6>Built-In Security Scanning Tools</h6>
<p>Securing apps in the modern internet era is a challenging feat. A huge number of vulnerabilities are discovered regularly and it is challenging for all government applications to adhere to regular scanning and patching, as it is largely a reactive process and done manually. While such methods work to some extent, the cost is huge and the process is error prone. With built-in security scanning tools, the process becomes continuous and seamless.</p>

<h4>Why government agencies should adopt Nectar</h4>
<p>There are significant benefits in having a central platform for the hosting of applications for government agencies.</p>
<h6>Speed to Market</h6>
<p>Users can deliver and deploy apps much faster. They don’t have to waste valuable time in setting up the base infrastructure and the delivery pipeline.</p>
<br>
<h6>Cost Reduction</h6>
<p>Users benefit from a substantial reduction in cost of developing and maintaining apps with the Nectar platform. There is significant reduction in duplicate work across all government agencies.</p>
<br>
<h6>Easier Compliance</h6>
<p>Compliance is made much easier with the users having to only worry about the application security and audits. They don’t have to duplicate the efforts in auditing and complying to policies for the infrastructure.</p>
<br>
<h6>Dynamic Scalability</h6>
<p>With the use of containers and 12 factor app design, the applications can be scaled up or down dynamically in a matter of seconds. This optimises the resource utilisation and gives flexibility to the users.</p>
<br>
<h6>Continuous Delivery</h6>
<p>With a built-in delivery pipeline, users don’t have to manually do deployment and are able to push bug-fixes and new features quickly.</p>
<p>Other benefits are reduced maintenance efforts, portability through open standards and better application security.</p>
