<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Nectar is a platform-as-a-service hosting solution developed by GDS based on
    containers. It allows engineers to build and deploy applications directly
    from source code in their git repositories, bringing speed, reliability and
    simplicity to the Singapore Government's digital services. Nectar was also
    designed to meet the standards and security requirements mandated by the
    Government.</p>
<hr />
<h4>How Nectar works</h4>
<p>The Nectar platform was designed to integrate the complete delivery pipeline
    pulling the code from source-code repositories, performing the builds,
    running security scans, deploying the application, scaling on demand and
    monitoring.</p>
<h5>Containerised Application Delivery</h5>
<p>Docker container packaging provided a clean yet powerful way of delivering
    application packages to the platform. The container packages contain
    everything the application requires to run.</p>
<p>For orchestration of containers, Nectar uses OpenShift which is based on
    Kubernetes and commercially supported by Red Hat.</p>
<h6>Self-Service Provisioning and Deployment</h6>
<p>The Nectar portal provides a simple user interface for building and deploying
    containerised applications. Self-service capabilities reduce operational
    needs and manual errors. It also improved turn-around times for setting up
    new deployments significantly for the Government.</p>
<p>Once logged in, users can provision new services dynamically and allocate
    compute resources to their services as required.</p>
<h6>Built-In Security Scanning Tools</h6>
<p>Securing apps in the modern internet era is a challenging feat. A huge number
    of vulnerabilities are discovered regularly and it is challenging for all
    government applications to adhere to regular scanning and patching, as it is
    largely a reactive process and done manually. While such methods work to
    some extent, the cost is huge and the process is error prone. With built-in
    security scanning tools, the process becomes continuous and seamless.</p>

<h4>Why government agencies should adopt Nectar</h4>
<p>There are significant benefits in having a central platform for the hosting
    of applications for government agencies.</p>
<h5>Speed to Market</h5>
<p>Users can deliver and deploy apps much faster. They don’t have to waste
    valuable time in setting up the base infrastructure and the delivery
    pipeline.</p>
<h5>Cost Reduction</h5>
<p>Users benefit from a substantial reduction in cost of developing and
    maintaining apps with the Nectar platform. There is significant reduction in
    duplicate work across all government agencies.</p>
<h5>Easier Compliance</h5>
<p>Compliance is made much easier with the users having to only worry about the
    application security and audits. They don’t have to duplicate the efforts in
    auditing and complying to policies for the infrastructure.</p>
<h5>Dynamic Scalability</h5>
<p>With the use of containers and 12 factor app design, the applications can be
    scaled up or down dynamically in a matter of seconds. This optimises the
    resource utilisation and gives flexibility to the users.</p>
<h5>Continuous Delivery</h5>
<p>With a built-in delivery pipeline, users don’t have to manually do deployment
    and are able to push bug-fixes and new features quickly.</p>
<p>Other benefits are reduced maintenance efforts, portability through open
    standards and better application security.</p>
