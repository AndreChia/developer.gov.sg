description: The official link shortener for the Singapore government
---

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  Go.gov.sg is the official Singapore government link shortener, built by the
  Open Government Products team in GovTech.
</p>
<p>
  There are multiple reasons why we built an official government link shortener:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    URLs are too long to fit into tweets or SMSes, and difficult to remember
  </li>
  <li>
    Email clients might block other commercial link shorteners if they are
    listed as spam on their site
  </li>
  <li>
    Citizens are afraid of phishing when receiving a shortened link and unsure
    of where it goes
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  With Go.gov.sg, citizens are safe in the knowledge that the links are
  official. Any public officer can log in with their government emails and
  immediately create short links with the official gov.sg domain.

<h4>Get Started</h4>
<p>
  Any public officer with an email ending in .gov.sg can login with their email.
  They will receive a One Time Password that is sent to that email.

<p>
  If you are a school staff member with an email ending in .edu.sg, please
  approach your school's IT team to ask about procuring a schools.gov.sg email
  address.
