<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  CorpPass is a corporate digital identity for businesses and other entities
  (such as non-profit organisations and associations) to transact with
  Government agencies online. Managed by Government Technology Agency (GovTech),
  CorpPass is the single login method for G2B transactions from 1 September
  2018.

<h4>Security / Better Control / Convenience</h4>
<p>
  Companies had provided feedback that some employees shared their SingPass
  details with one another to conduct company transactions. CorpPass enhances
  cyber hygiene by allowing employees to use CorpPass, instead of SingPass, to
  transact on their company's behalf. CorpPass also allows business owners
  greater control, with the flexibility of granting employees separate roles to
  access government digital services. Last but not least, it allows companies
  greater convenience and visibility, by providing a single platform to grant
  and manage the authorisations given to their employees across all government
  digital services.
</p>
<p>
  CorpPass has also been made available to foreign registered entities and
  individuals without SingPass, to transact with selected government agencies in
  Singapore.
</p>
<p>
  CorpPass supports the Smart Nation objectives, and the Government's aim to
  create secure and reliable digital services for citizens and businesses.
