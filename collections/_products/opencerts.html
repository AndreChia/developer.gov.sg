<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>GovTech Singapore developed OpenCerts in cooperation with the OpenCerts
    Consortium.</p>
<p>OpenCerts is the umbrella trademark under which we have released a few key
    components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An open source schema for publishing educational credentials</li>
    <li>A set of tools for generating cryptographic protections for educational
        credentials</li>
    <li>This online website for verifying the authenticity of OpenCerts files
    </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Features</h4>
<h6>Safe Personal Data</h6>
<p>Academic records of the certificate and personal data are not published on
    the blockchain. A hash is generated from the certificate and is used to
    prove that the certificate is legitimate. The process of computing the hash
    from the certificate is not reversible. Since the hash is the only
    information published into the blockchain, no personal information can be
    obtained from content on the blockchain.</p>
<h6>Backed by Blockchain Technology</h6>
<p>Using blockchain, we can greatly reduce the barrier to entry of publishing
    cryptographically protected educational credentials, as compared to
    currently existing costly proprietary software. In addition, a public
    blockchain is owned and maintained by the community and is easily accessible
    by anyone. As a result, there is no need to run or maintain services to
    verify OpenCerts.</p>

<h4>Get Started</h4>
<p>OpenCerts is currently in the early stages of progressive rollout. If you
    wish to know whether your educational institute supports OpenCerts, please
    contact their administrative office.</p>
