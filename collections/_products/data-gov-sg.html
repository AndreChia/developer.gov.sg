<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  Data.gov.sg was first launched in 2011 as the government's one-stop portal to
  its publicly-available datasets from 70 public agencies. To date, more than
  100 apps have been created using the government’s open data.
</p>
<p>
  The new data.gov.sg, now in public beta, goes beyond being a data repository.
  It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public,
  through the active use of charts and articles.
</p>
<p>
  We are actively working on new features and enhancements. We would like to
  invite feedback from members of the public on how we can further improve
  data.gov.sg and provide a better user experience for all.
