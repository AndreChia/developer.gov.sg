<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has revamped its online map services with new and enhanced features to make information more easily accessible and online transactions effortless. The new portal, named URA SPACE, is packed with useful data and visualisation to help building professionals, business operators and the general public in their decision-making.</p>
<p>URA SPACE consolidates detailed land use information and private property-related information onto a one-stop platform presented on geospatial maps. These are maps embedded with data for users to easily view and search for information. Users can access information relating to the master plan, urban design guidelines, private property use and approval, car park locations and availability, private residential property transactions, and conservation areas and buildings.</p>

<h4>Hassle-free access to information on change of use</h4>
<p>Key among the enhancements is a new function called “Allowable Use For Shophouses”. With this, users can readily check the allowable and last approved uses for private shophouses in Singapore and where necessary, will be guided to submit applications for the intended use.</p>
<p>For instance, if a business operator wants to set up a restaurant on premises where approval was already granted, further planning permission from URA is not required. In a different scenario, if a business operator wants to change the use from a restaurant to an office, this can be approved immediately but he/she will be prompted to make an online lodgement. On the other hand, if a business operator wishes to open a new restaurant at a location where new restaurants cannot be supported, he/she will be advised accordingly. The operator is also able to print a copy of the reply for record purposes or use it to obtain licences from other agencies. Such instant online replies will be of great help to business operators in their decision making.</p>
<p>Previously, a search fee of $53.50 (inclusive of GST) would apply to enquiries for approved uses of shophouse premises. Applicants may also take up to seven working days to receive the information. This new function, on trial for six months, provides the information instantaneously and at no charge, which would better enable users to make decisions to buy or rent shophouse premises for their intended use. </p>

<h4>One-stop access to private property and car parking information</h4>
<p>On URA SPACE, users can also obtain private property market transaction information by property types. There is also a data service that provides real-time parking availability in URA and HDB car parks, as well as carparks that provide data to the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</p>
<p>While the information on URA SPACE is provided freely and URA has made best efforts to ensure information accuracy, users should still seek legal, financial or other professional advice before any commitment is made to purchase or rent a private property.</p>
<p>URA SPACE is accessible on multiple devices, including Apple and Android tablet devices, enabling users to search and access the information they need while on the go. We will continue to enhance URA SPACE in phases, with plans to add on more information and features in the future.</p>
