---
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Hive Agile Testing Solutions (HATS) is a functional test automation tool for
    web and mobile applications. It allows government developers to define
    end-to-end test scenarios and implement the test steps/actions, together
    with assertion checks.</p>
<p>At the end of the automated tests, an HTML report is generated that allows
    you to determine the total execution time, pass/fail test cases and the step
    at which the failure happens, if any. HATS leverages the technical know-how
    of the Agile experts at Hive, as well as our experience with Agile testing,
    to help the Singapore Government deliver more robust and stable digital
    services.</p>

<h4>Why HATS?</h4>
<h5>Green Hats</h5>
<p>Green Hats is an automated functional regression testing platform for web and
    mobile apps. </p>
<p>Non-technical users can create their own test scenarios using an
    “English-style” scripting language to develop and execute automated tests.
    Writing test cases in this manner helps to shift the entire QA focus among
    the team as well as the business stakeholders. Everyone in the team is able
    to understand the test scenarios and contribute to them.</p>
<p>Users are able to run regression tests in parallel. This saves time and
    provides early feedback to the development team for any code-breaks. Tests
    can be executed in parallel in various browsers and mobile devices,
    including the HATS team's own device farm, so engineers can be sure that
    their application is able to run on these platforms. Green Hats offers
    detailed reports on points of failure and screenshots for debugging. </p>
<p>In addition, Green Hats can be used to virtualise external interfaces during
    testing, decoupling applications from their dependencies. A wide variety of
    protocols are covered, e.g. HTTP(S), JDBC, MQ.</p>
<h5>White Hats</h5>
<p>White Hats is an automated white box security testing tool. It offers static
    application security testing (SAST) capabilities, and can identify quality
    or security issues in source code.</p>
<p>With its fast feedback cycle, White Hats helps to drive and lower the effort
    needed to maintain code quality and security.</p>
<h5>CI/CD</h5>
<p>Continuous testing can be achieved by integrating hats into the Continuous
    Integration (CI) process, which is a very important Agile Continuous
    Delivery (CD) component.</p>

<h4>Future of HATS</h4>
<p>The future of HATS is promising. We have a huge list of product features with
    lots of focus on usability, ease of script development and configurations.
</p>
<p>We also plan to add on security assessment, and load and performance
    capabilities. This will make HATS a comprehensive product that government
    agencies can rely on to deliver high quality digital services for our
    citizens and businesses.</p>
