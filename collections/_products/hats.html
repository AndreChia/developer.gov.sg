<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  HATS is a functional test automation tool for web and mobile applications. It
  allows you to define end-to-end test scenarios and implement the test
  steps/actions, together with assertion checks.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the automated tests, an HTML report is generated that allows you
  to determine the total execution time, pass/fail test cases and the step at
  which the failure happens, if any. hats leverages the technical know-how of
  the Agile experts at Hive, as well as our experience with Agile testing, to
  help the Singapore Government deliver more robust and stable digital services.

<h4>Why HATS?</h4>
<p>
  HATS allows users to create their test scenarios using the “Specification by
  Examples” or, as we like to call it, “English-style” scripting. Writing your
  test cases in this manner helps to shift the entire QA focus among the team as
  well as the business stakeholders. Everyone in the team is able to understand
  the test scenarios and contribute to them.
</p>
<p>
  Users are able to run regression tests in parallel. This saves time and
  provides early feedback to the development team for any code-breaks.
</p>
<p>
  HATS can be executed in parallel in various browsers and mobile devices, so
  you can be sure your application is able to run on these platforms.
</p>
<p>
  Continuous testing can be achieved by integrating hats into the Continuous
  Integration (CI) process, which is a very important Agile Continuous Delivery
  (CD) component.

<h4>Future of HATS</h4>
<p>
  The future of HATS is promising. We have a huge list of product features with
  lots of focus on usability, and ease of script development and configurations.
</p>
<p>
  We also plan to add on security assessment, and load and performance
  capabilities. This will make HATS a comprehensive product that government
  agencies can rely on to deliver high quality digital services for our citizens
  and businesses.
