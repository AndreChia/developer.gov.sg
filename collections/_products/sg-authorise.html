<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>SG Authorise is a remote authorisation service which businesses can use to
    notify and seek authorisation from customers. For example, an insurance
    company can notify a customer that his car insurance policy is expiring and
    seek authorisation from him/her to renew it for another year. Individuals
    will receive the notification on SingPass Mobile, and they can provide their
    authorisation by digitally signing the renewal request using digital
    cryptographic keys within SingPass Mobile.</p>
