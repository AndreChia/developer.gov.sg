<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>SHIP stands for Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline. It offers a continuous
    integration and continuous deployment (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank">CI/CD</a>)
    platform that automates the delivery of applications and simplifies policy
    clearance. This is done through incorporating a Common Development Stack,
    Standard Build Management and Centralised Release Management for application
    development in both internet and government intranet environments.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<h5>Common Development Stack</h5>
<p>Tools for team document sharing, project tracking, source code and binary
    management in a secure development environment.</p>
<h5>Common Build Environment</h5>
<p>Provides managed build engines and automated software builds for continuous
    integration and secure library management in an application's development
    cycle.</p>
<h5>Release Management (upcoming)</h5>
<p>Continuous deployment and delivery to multiple target hosts and zones. SHIP
    would serve as a centralised platform featuring build artifact reviews,
    release reviews, audit reviews, controlled releases with authorisation and
    authentication, release monitoring and release configuration management.</p>
<p>Note: SHIP only provides the tools to support a CI/CD pipeline. Users would
    still have to set up these pipelines themselves or through a vendor.</p>
