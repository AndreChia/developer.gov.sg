<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  FormSG is a form builder tool for government to self-service and create online
  forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.
  Since it began in September 2017, it has replaced thousands of paper forms and
  are used by over 80 agencies such as MOM, MOE, PA and SportSG. More than
  10,000 public officers are already on it. There is no onboarding process.
  Officers with @gov.sg emails can sign up.

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>
  FormSG has a simple to use interface to build your form. After you create your
  form, you may share your form link to your users. When users submit your form,
  responses either go directly to your email or are stored in encrypted form on
  our server. These are the two response modes available: Email mode and Storage
  mode.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>How does FormSG handle classified data?</h4>
<p>
  FormSG can capture classified data, because in both Email and Storage mode,
  data is not stored on FormSG servers. Visit Email mode and Storage mode to
  find out the specific data classification and data sensitivity FormSG can
  handle.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>What is the price?</h4>
<p>FormSG is free to use.</p>
<p>
  Forms that enable SingPass (SP) or CorpPass (CP) authentication will however
  have to pay for these external services. For more information on SPCP refer to
  the SPCP section.

<h4>I am not part of the government. Can I use FormSG?</h4>
<p>
  Today we enable government agencies and select government related
  organisations, such as public hospitals, to use FormSG. If you are part of a
  private sector organisation that is keen on using FormSG, we have plans to
  release an open-source version in 2020. If you are part of a government
  related organisation, you may write in to formsg@tech.gov.sg to request for
  your organisation’s email domain to be whitelisted.
