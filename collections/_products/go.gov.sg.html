description: The official link shortener for the Singapore government

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Go.gov.sg is the official Singapore government link shortener, built by the
    Open Government Products team in GovTech.</p>
<p>An official link shortener allows government employees to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>craft URLs that are too long to fit into tweets or SMSes, and difficult
        to remember</li>
    <li>send links to email clients that block other commercial link shorteners
    </li>
    <li>send links to citizens who are afraid of phishing when receiving a
        shortened link and unsure of where it goes</li>
</ul>
<p>With Go.gov.sg, citizens are safe in the knowledge that the links are
    official. Any public officer can log in with their government email and
    immediately create short links with the official gov.sg domain.</p>
