<p>
  The Singapore Government's less sensitive Government ICT systems can be hosted
  on commercial cloud providers, enabling the use of leading-edge private sector
  capabilities to develop digital services. A small number of very sensitive and
  critical systems will remain hosted within Government, even as the global norm
  is increasingly for ICT systems to be cloud-based.

  Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) is a key part of the CODEX (Core Operations,
  Development Environment, and eXchange) which is the digital platform to enable
  the Government to deliver better digital services to citizens faster and more
  cost efficiently.
