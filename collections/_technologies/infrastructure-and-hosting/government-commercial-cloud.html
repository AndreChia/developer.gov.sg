<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The Singapore Government's less sensitive Government ICT systems can be hosted
  on commercial cloud providers, enabling the use of leading-edge private sector
  capabilities to develop digital services. A small number of very sensitive and
  critical systems will remain hosted within Government, even as the global norm
  is increasingly for ICT systems to be cloud-based.
</p>
<p>
  Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) is a key part of the CODEX (Core Operations,
  Development Environment, and eXchange) which is the digital platform to enable
  the Government to deliver better digital services to citizens faster and more
  cost efficiently.

<h3>Benefits of using Commercial Cloud</h3>
<h4>Access to leading ICT capabilities</h4>
<p>
  Commercial cloud will grant the Government access to leading edge innovations
  and developments in the technology industry. Global tech giants have invested
  significantly in their commercial cloud platforms, incorporating the latest
  ICT capabilities in the software and services offered. These leading ICT
  capabilities are augmented by robust cybersecurity measures and systems, to
  protect the data that resides on commercial cloud platforms.
</p>
<h4>Agility, speed and scale</h4>
<p>
  Government agencies can tap on commercial cloud software to incorporate
  advanced functionalities into their digital services, instead of trying to
  reinvent the wheel. Application testing and deployment can be automated and
  done in real-time, speeding up the delivery of high-quality Government digital
  services to citizens and businesses.
</p>
<h4>Cost savings and operational efficiencies</h4>
<p>
  Commercial cloud will help the Government achieve better cost and operational
  efficiencies in its digital transformation. Instead of building, managing and
  maintaining onpremise and dedicated hosting infrastructure such as data
  centres, the Government will derive greater economies of scale through the use
  of commercial cloud. The availability and reliability of our ICT systems will
  be raised in a cost efficient manner.
