<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Designed by the Government, MyInfo is a “Tell Us Once” service that
    eliminates the need for citizens to repeatedly provide and verify the same
    personal information when transacting online. Businesses can use MyInfo APIs
    to obtain information about individuals upon their consent. For example,
    banks and financial institutions used this for eKYC for online application
    and instant approvals for bank account opening, credit card applications and
    loan applications.</p>
