  SafeEntry - Combating Clusters through Check-Ins
</h2>
<p>
  As more activities and services gradually resume following the circuit breaker period,
  it is important to put in place efforts to prevent and control the transmission of
  COVID-19 such as contact tracing and quicker identification of COVID-19 clusters.
</p>
<p>
  Developed by GovTech, SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs
  identifying details of individuals (identification card and mobile numbers)
  visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces, as well as communal activity areas.
  SafeEntry helps support and quicken efforts by providing authorities with a record of
  individuals who enter and exit these places.
</p>
<p>
  These records will reduce the time needed to identify potential close contacts of
  COVID-19 patients and clusters. We encourage everyone to use SafeEntry to check-in
  and check-out when going about your daily activities.
</p>

<h3>How does SafeEntry work?</h3>
<p>
  To ensure that checking in and out is quick, convenient and accessible for all,
  there are several check-in methods available for use, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry QR</b> - Using the iPhone default camera app (for Apple users) or
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trendmicro.qrscan&hl=en_SG">Trend Micro QR Scanner</a>
    (for Android users), users can easily scan the QR code at locations that
    require SafeEntry check-ins. From there, they will be redirected to a
    browser page to key in their personal particulars and complete their check-in.

  </figure>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry with SingPass Mobile (SPM)</b> - SafeEntry has also been
    integrated into the widely-used SPM app as a means to streamline the check-in process.
    When authenticating through SingPass, users need not enter their details manually.
    Users have the option of scanning the QR code via the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAgug6uVKIc&feature=youtu.be">in-app scanner</a>
    or
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hp--r7ipUI&feature=youtu.be">
      selecting from a list of nearby locations
    </a> to complete the check-in process.
  </li>

  </figure>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry NRIC</b> - As an alternative to these digital check-in processes,
    users can opt to have their identification cards scanned at the entrances of locations.
    A personalised barcode is also available on both the SingPass Mobile and
    TraceTogether apps for scanning.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry with TraceTogether app</b> - SafeEntry has also integrated with the
    TraceTogether app. Users can scan the SafeEntry QR code and check-in without entering
    their details manually.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How is my data protected?</h3>
<p>
  The data collected via SafeEntry is encrypted and stored in the Government server,
  which will only be accessed by the authorities for the purpose of contact tracing.
  The Government is the custodian of the data submitted by individuals, and there are
  stringent measures in place to safeguard personal data. Only authorised public officers
  will have access to the data.
</p>
<p>The personal data will be purged when it is no longer needed for such purposes. </p>

<h3>Are location permissions mandatory?</h3>
<p>
  When using SingPass Mobile to check-in to a location, the app requires location permissions
  to detect nearby locations for users to select. However, this data is strictly used for
  SafeEntry purposes and users who do not wish to enable these permissions can opt to use
  the QR scanning function or have their identification cards scanned instead.

<h3>What is the SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check Service?</h3>
<p>
  The SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check Service helps members of the public
  recall if they had previously been at the locations visited by COVID-19 cases.
  The service allows users to check if they had been in proximity to someone
  with COVID-19. Additionally, SMS alerts are sent to those who were at
  locations assessed to pose a higher risk of transmission at the same time as
  COVID-19 cases.
</p>
<p>
  This service was launched following public feedback. It is intended as a
  precautionary measure for users, and does not replace existing contract
  tracing protocols.
</p>
<h3>How does the self-check feature work?</h3>
<p>
  The service matches users’ SafeEntry records against the locations and timings
  of visits by COVID-19 cases to public places, which are announced by the
  Ministry of Health.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Making better sense of MOH’s information</strong>. The Self-Check
      service is meant to complement MOH’s announcement of public locations
      visited by COVID-19 cases (for more than 30 minutes during their
      infectious period).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Helping users assess possible exposure</strong>. By providing
      individuals who were at the same mall or building (based on their
      SafeEntry records captured at different locations within the mall or
      building), it will help them to recall if they had been near the
      location(s) visited by the COVID-19 case.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiple front-ends to self-check</strong>: Users are able to
      access to self-check their matches via the TraceTogether app, SingPass
      Mobile or on the SafeEntry
      <a
        href="https://wereyouthere.safeentry.gov.sg/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        >website</a
      >. For those wishing to use the self-check service but without access to
      smartphones or computers, they may seek assistance with the SafeEntry
      Self-Check Service from Citizens Connect Centres located at Our Tampines
      Hub and 26 community centres island-wide.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>What if a user did not check-out after his or her visit</strong
      >? Without a check-out record, it is more difficult to match and
      ascertain if a user was at the same location during the same timings as
      the COVID-19 case. In this scenario, the Self-Check service will provide
      the SafeEntry check-in timings if the user had checked in at the location
      (without checking-out) within a 12-hour period before announced visits of
      COVID-19 cases, as there could be a likelihood of an overlap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Those using the Location Matching Self-Check Service are only shown
        SafeEntry records that are matched as a possible COVID-19
        exposure</strong
      >. The diagram below explains the criteria used to determine a user’s
      possible exposure matches:

<h3>How does the SMS notification service work?</h3>
<p>
  SMS notifications are only sent to a smaller group of individuals who were at
  locations that are assessed to pose a higher risk of transmission, such as
  dining places and gyms where people do not wear masks for extended periods of
  time.
</p>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Individuals who receive the SMS notification are advised to monitor
        their health closely for 14 days from the date of the match</strong
      >. They are also advised to see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms
      of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat, and runny
      nose), fever and loss of sense of taste or smell.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>What if a user did not check-out after his or her visit</strong
      >? Without a check-out record, it is more difficult to match and
      ascertain if a user was at the same location during the same timings as
      the COVID-19 case. In such a scenario, an SMS would be sent if the user
      had checked-in within one hour before the specified timing that the
      COVID-19 case was at the same location, as there is a higher likelihood of
      an overlap.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>How are the mobile numbers used to send SMS kept updated?</strong>
      The service utilises the most current mobile phone number provided by the
      user, across different channels depending on the mode used for check-in.
      More details on updating of mobile numbers
