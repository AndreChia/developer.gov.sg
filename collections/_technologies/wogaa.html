<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Launched in 2016, the Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)
    platform enables real-time, automatic monitoring of all government websites
    and digital services. It provides a set of common metrics and measurements
    that enable public agencies to conduct live performance monitoring of their
    websites and digital services in a convenient and cost-effective way. With
    more people interacting with the Government through websites and mobile
    applications, it is important for us to understand how our digital services
    are performing and continually enhance user experience. </p>
<p>Through a customised dashboard that depicts the overall health status of
    government websites and digital services, agencies are able to understand
    user behaviour and in turn improve service delivery. Metrics tracked include
    downloads, number of clicks, bounce rate and abandonment rate. There are
    many analytical tools in the market that can be used to track digital
    consumption such as tools from market leaders Google (Google Analytics) and
    Adobe (Adobe Analytics) but these tools require manpower to implement and
    maintain and may incur substantial costs.</p>
