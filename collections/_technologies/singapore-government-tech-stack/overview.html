<h2>Introducing Singapore Government Tech Stack</h2>
<p>
Does Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) sound familiar?
We briefly mentioned it in our Virtual Cloud Day 2 recap as
part of the next steps in adopting cloud for Whole-of-Government (WOG)
in the June issue of the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) Newsletter.
</p>
<p>A tech stack may refer to different sets of applications, depending on the context. As such, we intend to standardise the definition of SGTS with a clear product roadmap and adoption support plan. GovTech has assembled a new CODEX (Core Operations Development Environment and eXchange) team to do so. Through the use of SGTS, Agencies can then focus on building less and delivering more.</p>
<h3>Getting to know CODEX</h3>
<p>
CODEX is a Strategic National Project for <strong>achieving Singapore’s Smart Nation vision by increasing engineering productivity.</strong> The CODEX team’s <strong>goals are to drive the GCC and SGTS products for use in WoG development</strong>, while adhering to security audit and compliance. Using highly reusable software components in a collaborative environment are expected to reduce operating costs.
</p>
<p>
The team will help Agencies and vendors understand the product vision, strategy and execution in a timely way, and progressively, help Agencies <strong>accelerate their transformative development</strong> on the Cloud.
</p>
<p>
We welcome Agencies’ engagement with the CODEX team through provision of early feedback, in order to influence the product roadmap and feature prioritisation. The team will work closely with various Capability Centres to build new products and continue to improve existing ones.
</p>
<h3>What is SGTS?</h3>
<p>
The core focus of SGTS is to supercharge developers with agile development and modernise the development practice with reusable components. Today, GCC reduces repetition of acquiring and configuring servers, which minimises set-up errors and costs. With SGTS, Agencies will have access to reusable components for application development, such as Runtime (e.g. deployment types like containers and serverless) and Orchestration & Management (e.g., CI/CD, API Gateway and Service Proxy). This will then allow Agencies to <strong>build less and deliver more.</strong>

<h3>SGTS Product Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  SGTS comprises a two-layer architecture — Base Layer and Services Layer ¬— with components
   that make up the app development lifecycle, from set-up to going live.
</p>
<h5>Base Layer</h5>
The base layer is the standardised layer consisting of five (5) components with the application stack at its core.

<h5>Services Layer</h5>
The services layer is composed of rapidly evolving and widely applicable, reusable service components in areas including App services, Data & Analytics, Identity, AI and data exchange.
