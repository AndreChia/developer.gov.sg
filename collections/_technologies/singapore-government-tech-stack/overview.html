<h2>Introducing Singapore Government Tech Stack</h2>
<p>
Does Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) sound familiar?
We briefly mentioned it in our Virtual Cloud Day 2 recap as
part of the next steps in adopting cloud for Whole-of-Government (WOG)
in the June issue of the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) Newsletter.

 <div class="column"><p>A tech stack may refer to different sets of applications, depending on the context. As such, we intend to standardise the definition of SGTS with a clear product roadmap and adoption support plan.GovTech has assembled a new CODEX (Core Operations Development Environment and eXchange) team to do so. Through the use of SGTS, Agencies can then focus on building less and delivering more.</p></div>

           <h4>Getting to know CODEX</h4>
           <p>
             CODEX is a Strategic National Project for <strong>achieving Singapore’s Smart Nation vision by increasing engineering productivity.</strong> The CODEX team’s <strong>goals are to drive the GCC and SGTS products for use in WoG development</strong>, while adhering to security audit and compliance. Using highly reusable software components in a collaborative environment are expected to reduce operating costs.</p>
             <p>The team will help Agencies and vendors understand the product vision, strategy and execution in a timely way, and progressively, help Agencies <strong>accelerate their transformative development</strong> on the Cloud.</p>
               <p>We welcome Agencies’ engagement with the CODEX team through provision of early feedback, in order to influence the product roadmap and feature prioritisation. The team will work closely with various Capability Centres to build new products and continue to improve existing ones.
