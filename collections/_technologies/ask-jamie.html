<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Conceptualised in 2014, ‘Ask Jamie’ is a virtual assistant (VA) that can be
  implemented on agency websites and trained to be able to answer queries within
  specific domains. To date, Ask Jamie has been implemented across 70 government
  agency websites. The VA technology helps to provide direct responses to
  citizens who prefer to search for information online, and in turn, manpower
  can be re-directed to handle more complex queries and issues.
</p>
<p>
  Ask Jamie taps on its Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to understand
  the questions posed by the public and responds with an appropriate answer.
  When an answer entails multiple permutations, Ask Jamie can be trained to ask
  follow-on questions to refine the answer to one relevant to the user’s query.

<h2>Tips for interacting with Ask Jamie</h2>
<p>
  For readers who want to hold an efficient yet meaningful conversation with Ask
  Jamie, here are some best practices to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Read the list of ‘most popular’ questions first</b> - Each government
    agency has compiled a list of frequently asked questions it receives from
    citizens. When you click on the Ask Jamie tab, these questions are surfaced
    immediately, with links to the relevant answers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pay attention to the ‘Are you looking for’ options</b> - As you type in
    your question, Ask Jamie will try to predict what you are searching for and
    provide suggestions, much like the autofill function in the Google search
    bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ask one question per sentence</b> - For example, instead of asking ‘How
    can I appeal a traffic fine and what are the grounds for appeal?’, consider
    splitting your question into two separate sentences, i.e., ‘How can I appeal
    a traffic offence?’ followed by ‘What are the grounds for appealing a
    traffic offence?’.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Be concise</b> - Keep your questions short and sweet. Remember, the
    chatbot is looking out for keywords in your question, so don’t confuse it
    with an essay of background information describing the circumstances leading
    up to your query.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Speak slowly when using Ask Jamie Voice</b> - To help Ask Jamie
    accurately understand what you are saying, avoid areas with loud background
    noises and speak at a slow and measured pace.
  </li>
</ul>
