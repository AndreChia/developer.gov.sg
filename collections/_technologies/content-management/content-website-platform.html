<p>
  The CWP is a common secured environment based on a resilient, robust and
  controlled platform which provides a suite of standardised software for
  hosting content-based websites. It enables unclassified government websites to
  be centrally managed and operated on public cloud, bringing the benefits of
  convenience, greater security, optimisation of resources, faster deployment
  speed and cost savings through economies of scale.
</p>
<p>
  With the CWP, agencies only have to manage their own websites and they can
  focus on delivering the best possible user experience. Everything else is
  handled for them by GovTech.
</p>
<h2>Hosting Environment</h2>
<p>
  CWP is hosted in the Public Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and G-Cloud, IM8
  Compliant Hosting Environment, for the ‘unclassified’ front-end website and
  ‘restricted’ form services respectively.
</p>
<p>
  CWP offers two categories of services, Base Services and Catalogue Buy
  Services. Base Services include virtual hosting environment services (AWS) and
  Form services (G-Cloud or Government Cloud), bundled security infrastructure
  services and security management services.
</p>
<p>
  Agencies can choose from 3 website tiers for the virtual hosting environment
  services: Small (Website page views of 50,000 per day and website data
  transfer of 5GB), Medium (Website page views of 200,000 per day and website
  data transfer of 20GB), and Large (Website page views of 800,000 per day and
  website data transfer of 5GB).
</p>
<p>
  There are similar categories for Form Services with small, medium and large
  for form traffic of 200, 400 and 800 per day respectively.
</p>
<h2>Integrated, Centrally-Managed Security</h2>
<p>
  CWP centrally manages the security protection of all hosted websites, through
  a range of integrated security infrastructure and management services.
</p>
<h2>Content Publishing Services</h2>
<p>
  This falls under the ‘Catalogue Buy Services’. (Catalogue Buy also includes a
  range of miscellaneous services, such as additional website traffic, form
  traffic, data storage; invoice options; urgent service requests; and
  performance test tools.)
</p>
<p>
  CWP provides improved manageability and operational efficiency with five
  Content Management Systems (CMS) standardised software. Customer may bring
  their own CMS licenses over to CWP provided the licensing scheme is supported
  in CWP. Alternatively, customer may procure the CMS licenses in CWP. They can
  choose to deploy HTML websites where CMSes are not required.
</p>
<p>
  The five supported CMSes are WordPress which is Open Source (with commercial
  support for plug-ins) and four proprietary CMSes, namely SharePoint, SiteCore,
  Swiit and Sitefinity.
</p>
<h2>Simple Process for Agencies</h2>
<p>
  Agencies developing and deploying websites through CWP follow a simple 4-step
  process. GovTech has developed self-service portals for Service, Deployment,
  Security, Utilisation, User management, operations and service desk.
</p>
<p>
  The requester goes on to the Service portal and signs up for an account. Once
  the account is approved, the requester can subscribe for the tier of service
  they want. After provisioning for the staging and production environment, the
  developer can start deploying their codes through the Deployment portal and
  then conduct user testing.
</p>
<p>
  This is followed by booking and running security tests through the Security
  portal. Once vulnerability and penetration testing is completed, the security
  findings verified and any loopholes remediated, the agencies can deploy the
  website and go live.
