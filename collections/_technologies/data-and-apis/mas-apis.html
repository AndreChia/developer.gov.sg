<p>
  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides APIs for developers to
  access relevant data from MAS. For instance, companies can make use of MAS'
  exchange rate APIs to automate the extraction of exchange rates for tax filing
  with IRAS; software developers could use MAS' interest rates data to
  illustrate interest rates trends.
