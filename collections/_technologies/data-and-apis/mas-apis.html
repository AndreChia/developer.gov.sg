<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The APIs enable you to extract the relevant datasets on the MAS website for
  your applications and systems in a seamless manner. For instance, companies
  can make use of MAS' exchange rate APIs to automate the extraction of exchange
  rates for tax filing with IRAS; software developers could use MAS' interest
  rates data to illustrate interest rates trends.
