## Overview

Apex is a self-service API platform that acts as a centralised and secure API gateway for the Government. On Apex, users can easily publish, secure, monitor, and discovery APIs.

With APEX, data collected and stored by one agency can be used by numerous other approved agencies or businesses to improve and streamline their own processes. For example, [MyInfo](/technologies/digital-identity/national-digital-identity) leverages the capabilities of APEX to enable citizens and residents to manage the use of their personal data for a myriad of online transactions, including applying for a Housing Development Board flat and opening a bank account. The MyInfo API for developers makes it possible for more applications to be integrated with MyInfo without significant hassle or overhead costs.
