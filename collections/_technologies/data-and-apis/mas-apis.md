## Overview

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) provides APIs for developers to access relevant data from MAS. For instance, companies can make use of MAS' exchange rate APIs to automate the extraction of exchange rates for tax filing with IRAS; software developers could use MAS' interest rates data to illustrate interest rates trends.

### Get Started

MAS will progressively release more datasets as APIs. If you are interested in a particular dataset,Â [you may contact MAS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/feedback/).
