description: Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline (SHIP) provides managed services for development teams such as task trackers, source code repositories and CICD tooling that allow applications to be built faster and with more confidence
---

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  SHIP stands for Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline. It offers a continuous
  integration and continuous deployment (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD"
    >CI/CD</a
  >) platform that automates the delivery of applications and simplifies policy
  clearance. This is done through incorporating a Common Development Stack,
  Standard Build Management and Centralised Release Management for application
  development in both internet and government intranet environments.
</p>
<p>
  SHIP allows teams to simplify and shorten the process of building, testing and
  releasing their software. It enables engineers to ship quality, reliable
  software with a high level of confidence.

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Common Development Stack</h4>
<p>
  Tools for team document sharing, project tracking, source code and binary
  management in a secure development environment.
</p>
<h4>Common Build Environment</h4>
<p>
  Provides managed build engines and automated software builds for continuous
  integration and secure library management in an application's development
  cycle.
</p>
<h4>Release Management (upcoming)</h4>
<p>
  Continuous deployment and delivery to multiple target hosts and zones. SHIP
  would serve as a centralised platform featuring build artifact reviews,
  release reviews, audit reviews, controlled releases with authorisation and
  authentication, release monitoring and release configuration management.
</p>
<p>
  Note: SHIP only provides the tools to support a CI/CD pipeline. Users would
  still have to set up these pipelines themselves or through a vendor.
