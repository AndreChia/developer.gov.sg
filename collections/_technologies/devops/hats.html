---

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Hive Agile Testing Solutions (HATS) is a functional test automation tool for
  web and mobile applications. It allows government developers to define
  end-to-end test scenarios and implement the test steps/actions, together with
  assertion checks.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the automated tests, an HTML report is generated that allows you
  to determine the total execution time, pass/fail test cases and the step at
  which the failure happens, if any. HATS leverages the technical know-how of
  the Agile experts at Hive, as well as our experience with Agile testing, to
  help the Singapore Government deliver more robust and stable digital services.

<h2>Why HATS?</h2>
<h3>Green Hats</h3>
<p>
  Green Hats is an automated functional regression testing platform for web and
  mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
  Non-technical users can create their own test scenarios using an
  “English-style” scripting language to develop and execute automated tests.
  Writing test cases in this manner helps to shift the entire QA focus among the
  team as well as the business stakeholders. Everyone in the team is able to
  understand the test scenarios and contribute to them.
</p>
<p>
  Users are able to run regression tests in parallel. This saves time and
  provides early feedback to the development team for any code-breaks. Tests can
  be executed in parallel in various browsers and mobile devices, including the
  HATS team's own device farm, so engineers can be sure that their application
  is able to run on these platforms. Green Hats offers detailed reports on
  points of failure and screenshots for debugging.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Green Hats can be used to virtualise external interfaces during
  testing, decoupling applications from their dependencies. A wide variety of
  protocols are covered, e.g. HTTP(S), JDBC, MQ.
</p>
<h3>White Hats</h3>
<p>
  White Hats is an automated white box security testing tool. It offers static
  application security testing (SAST) capabilities, and can identify quality or
  security issues in source code.
</p>
<p>
  With its fast feedback cycle, White Hats helps to drive and lower the effort
  needed to maintain code quality and security.
</p>
<h3>CI/CD</h3>
<p>
  Continuous testing can be achieved by integrating hats into the Continuous
  Integration (CI) process, which is a very important Agile Continuous Delivery
  (CD) component.
</p>
<h2>Future of HATS</h2>
<p>
  The future of HATS is promising. We have a huge list of product features with
  lots of focus on usability, ease of script development and configurations.
</p>
<p>
  We also plan to add on security assessment, and load and performance
  capabilities. This will make HATS a comprehensive product that government
  agencies can rely on to deliver high quality digital services for our citizens
  and businesses.
