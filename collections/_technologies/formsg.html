<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>FormSG is a form builder tool for government employees to create online forms
    capable of handling sensitive data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.
    Since it began in September 2017, it has replaced thousands of paper forms
    and is used by over 80 agencies and more than 10,000 public officers. It can
    be used be any public officers with gov.sg emails, with no on-boarding
    required.</p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>FormSG has a simple to use interface to build your form. After you create
    your form, you may share your form link to your users. When users make form
    submissions, responses either go directly to your secure email inbox or are
    encrypted and stored on FormSG's servers, with the encryption key held by
    the form creator. For more information on storage modes, see the <a
        href="https://guide.form.gov.sg" target="_blank">form.sg
        documentation</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h4>What is the price?</h4>
<p>FormSG is free to use.</p>
<p>Users that want to create forms with SingPass (SP) or CorpPass (CP)
    authentication will however have to pay for these external services. For
    more information on SPCP, see the <a href="https://guide.form.gov.sg/"
        target="_blank">form.sg documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>I am not part of the government. Can I use FormSG?</h4>
<p>Government agencies and select government related organisations, such as
    public hospitals can use FormSG. If you are part of a private sector
    organisation that is keen on using FormSG, we have plans to release an
    open-source version in 2020. If you are part of a government related
    organisation, you may write in to formsg@tech.gov.sg to request for your
    organisation’s email domain to be whitelisted.</p>
