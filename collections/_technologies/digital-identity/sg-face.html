<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SG Face is an identity verification service using facial recognition that
    businesses can integrate with “as-a-service”. Facial verification gives
    businesses an additional/alternative way of verifying a person’s identity,
    without the need and burden to collect biometric data. It can be used as
    step-up authentication process to achieve a higher level of identity
    assurance, or as a way to simplify customer verification processes, or in
    some situation, as a proof-of-presence (e.g., taking a test). Facial
    verification is done upon consent of individual and not for surveillance
    purposes.</p>
