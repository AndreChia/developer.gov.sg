  started.

<h3>MyInfo</h3>
<p>
  Designed by the Government, MyInfo is a “Tell Us Once” service that eliminates
  the need for citizens to repeatedly provide and verify the same personal
  information when transacting online. Businesses can use MyInfo APIs to obtain
  information about individuals upon their consent. For example, banks and
  financial institutions used this for eKYC for online application and instant
  approvals for bank account opening, credit card applications and loan
  applications. MyInfo allows citizens and businesses to benefit from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Reduced repetitive filling of personal information for multiple online
    transactions
  </li>
  <li>Reduced incidence of mistakes as a result of human error</li>
  <li>
    No more need for physical documents as verifications to complete
    transactions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>SG Login</h3>
<p>
  SG Login is an online authentication service that businesses can integrate
  with, allowing them to authenticate the users of their online services without
  implementing and operating their own infrastructure and systems. Unlike other
  commercial authentication services available in the market, the authentication
  services provided are based on verified data and thus offers a high level of
  identity assurance. Businesses avoid the high costs of operating their own
  authentication systems, and are able to gain access to 4 million users without
  the need for expensive customer acquisition.
</p>

<h3>SG Verify</h3>
<p>
  SG Verify is an identity verification service that businesses can integrate
  with for their physical shop front, as we believe one can be digital even in a
  physical setting.
</p>

<p>
  SG Verify can be used in any situation involving proof of identity in a
  physical setting, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verifying visitors’ identity in hospitals or in commercial buildings</li>
  <li>Proof of identity at bank branches or telco stores</li>
  <li>
    Signing up for credit cards or opening of utilities accounts at roadshows
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>SG Authorise</h3>
<p>
  SG Authorise is a remote authorisation service which businesses can use to
  notify and seek authorisation from customers. For example, an insurance
  company can notify a customer that his car insurance policy is expiring and
  seek authorisation from him/her to renew it for another year. Individuals will
  receive the notification on SingPass Mobile, and they can provide their
  authorisation by digitally signing the renewal request using digital
  cryptographic keys within SingPass Mobile.
</p>

<h3>SG Sign</h3>
<p>
  SG Sign allows businesses and their customers to digitally sign a document, be
  it a contract, agreement or statutory filing. A digitally signed document
  provides a high level of assurance of the identity of the signers, integrity
  of the documents, non-repudiation of the transaction, and enjoy legal
  presumptions under the Electronics Transaction Act in Singapore.
</p>

<h3>SG Face</h3>
<p>
  SG Face is an identity verification service using facial recognition that
  businesses can integrate with “as-a-service”. Facial verification gives
  businesses an additional/alternative way of verifying a person’s identity,
  without the need and burden to collect biometric data. It can be used as
  step-up authentication process to achieve a higher level of identity
  assurance, or as a way to simplify customer verification processes, or in some
  situation, as a proof-of-presence (e.g., taking a test). Facial verification
  is done upon consent of individual and not for surveillance purposes.
