<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Transactional websites provide users with the ability to conduct transactions
    through the financial institution's website by initiating banking
    transactions or buying products and services.</p>
<p>Transactional websites typically enable the electronic exchange of
    confidential user information and the transfer of funds, services provided
    through these websites expose a financial institution to higher risk than
    static and dynamic informational websites.</p>
<p>Wholesale e-banking systems typically expose financial institutions to the
    highest risk per transaction, since commercial transactions usually involve
    larger dollar amounts. In addition to the risk issues associated with
    informational websites, examiners reviewing transactional e-banking services
    should consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Security controls for safeguarding user information</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Authentication processes necessary to initially verify the identity
            of new users and authenticate existing users who access e-banking
            services</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Liability for unauthorized transactions</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Losses from fraud if the institution fails to verify the identity of
            individuals or businesses applying for new accounts or credit
            on-line</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Possible violations of laws or regulations pertaining to consumer
            privacy, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, or the content,
            timing, or delivery of required consumer disclosures</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Negative public perception, user dissatisfaction, and potential
            liability resulting from failure to process third-party payments as
            directed or within specified time frames, lack of availability of
            on-line services, or unauthorized access to confidential user
            information during transmission or storage.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
