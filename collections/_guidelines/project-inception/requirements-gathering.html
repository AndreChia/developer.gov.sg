title: Requirements Gathering

<p>
  Requirements need to be intentionally gathered. Instead of simply asking for a
  list of features from stakeholders or users, it is an iterative process
  involving constantly asking relevant questions. Decisions purely based on
  subject opinions have no place in this phase.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, ensure compliance by setting up standards and procedures
  that ensure that projects are executed within overall objectives. To drive
  accountability, transparency and visibility should be enforced, where roles
  and deliverables are clearly articulated.
</p>
<p>Requirements gathering consist of the following phases:&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conceptualisation</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of product conceptualisation is to try out different possible
  solutions to the problems that have been prioritised during discovery, before
  committing to the agile development of a digital product or service. This
  means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Challenging the ways things are done and exploring new approaches</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating prototypes to experiment with different possible solutions</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Testing the riskiest assumptions</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Building to the fidelity necessary to learn, not production-ready code
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      What we learn through product conceptualisation will guide which of the
      possible solutions are worth taking into agile development. It should not
      be an exercise to simply gather requirements and translate into a product
      backlog.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Example activities during product conceptualisation include looking at how a
  possible solution would affect the wider service journey, gaining an
  understanding of what would need to happen to make the journey as a whole work
  as well as possible, exploring how possible solutions can both meet user needs
  and work within identified constraints, defining the product vision and
  roadmap, gathering sufficient evidence to help inform the budget, resourcing
  and time estimates to deliver an MVP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It is not a failure if the project does not proceed to agile development - if
  the research shows that existing/off-the-shelf digital solutions can
  adequately meet users’ needs and are more cost-effective.
</p>
<h3>Deciding whether to move on to agile development of an MVP</h3>
<p>
  There’s no set time period for conceptualisation, but around 3 to 4 months is
  typical. Let the complexity of your problem space and potential solutions
  dictate how long the team spends on it. If you get to the end of your timeline
  and you’re not confident, you could pause or decide to repeat discovery or
  conceptualisation as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  Product conceptualisation is finished when you’ve got a prototype that’s
  substantial enough to help you make a decision about whether to invest in the
  agile development of an MVP or not. An MVP is a platform with just enough
  features to test an idea out into the market, with the purpose of learning
  quickly what works and doesn’t work, in order to guide the development of the
  product. This allows the team to work out how to deliver the most business or
  customer value with the least amount of features.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  If you decide to proceed to construct an MVP, note that frequent iterative
  releases is encouraged, where continuous feedback collected results in
  finetuning of user-centric design features and the technical infrastructure
  supporting it.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>However, do not proceed to construct the MVP if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>There are better commercial / industry solutions</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>The potential impact does not justify the potential effort and cost</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Partner stakeholders are not able to run agile, user-centred practices
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Full-scale implementation is not viable from a policy, ops or service
        perspective
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Dependent agencies are not able to support the operationalisation of the
        solution
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When you’re confident you want to move on to beta, partner with your
        product, tech and business leads (and agency stakeholders) to work on a
        funding proposal.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Prototyping</h3>
<p>
  Always start with low-fi prototypes, as its cheaper construction and
  modification allows for fast iterations. It is important to weigh the
  cost-vs-certainty of change, where the more certain it is that a product
  requires lesser changes, the more feasible it is to use a high-fi
  prototype.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Prioritisation matrix&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
  Employ a prioritisation matrix as a guide to prioritise the product features,
  next-steps and framework to deliver maximum value and impact with minimal cost
  and risk.
