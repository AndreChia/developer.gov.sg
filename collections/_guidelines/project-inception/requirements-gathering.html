title: Requirements Gathering

<p>
  Requirements need to be intentionally gathered. Instead of simply asking for a
  list of features from stakeholders or users, it is an iterative process
  involving constantly asking relevant questions. Avoid making major decisions
  purely based on subjective opinions.
</p>
<h3>Conceptualisation</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of product conceptualisation is to try out different possible
  solutions to the problems that have been prioritised during discovery, before
  committing to the agile development of a digital product or service. This
  means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Challenging the ways things are done and exploring new approaches</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating prototypes to experiment with different possible solutions</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Testing the riskiest assumptions</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Building to the fidelity necessary to learn, not production-ready code
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <a
      href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-to-build-service-blueprint-and-what-you-can-achieve-with-it"
      >Service Blueprint</a
    >
    allows teams to know exactly who are the people benefitting from this
    project. It is useful to develop narratives and storyboards that define the
    end-users’ touchpoint journeys - from when they encounter a task or problem,
    how they employ the conceived product as a solution, the various usage
    stages and interactions with the product, and possible user reactions and
    tangible results that can arise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The service blueprint should consist of the service providers’ inner
    workings and support structures that produce the user’s experience.
    Responsibilities of internal actors, processes and policies that regulate
    what can or cannot be done should be mapped. This can unite multiple
    stakeholders and team players (with different KPIs, fundings, etc) to agree
    on common requirements, objectives and aims.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  What is gathered through product conceptualisation will provide guidance on
  which of the possible solutions are worth taking into agile development. It
  should not be an exercise to simply gather requirements and translate into a
  product backlog.
</p>
<p>
  Example activities during product conceptualisation include looking at how a
  possible solution would affect the wider service journey, gaining an
  understanding of what would need to happen to make the journey as a whole
  work, exploring how possible solutions can both meet user needs and work
  within identified constraints, defining the product vision and roadmap,
  gathering sufficient evidence to help inform the budget, and resourcing and
  time estimates to deliver an MVP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It is not a failure if the project does not proceed to agile development if
  the research shows that existing/off-the-shelf digital solutions can
  adequately meet users’ needs while being more cost-effective.
</p>
<h3>Prototyping</h3>
<p>
  Always start with low fidelity prototypes since they are much cheaper to
  build, modify and iterate. Prototypes are used to validate hypotheses about
  the product’s problem and solution space with actual users. Move on to
  higher-fidelity prototypes when the product gains more certainty in features
  after continuously reviewing lower fidelity counterparts. High fidelity
  prototypes, which may include a minimal level of interactivity and
  functionality would take more time and money to change.
</p>
<h3>Moving past conceptualisation</h3>
<p>
  There’s no set time period for conceptualisation, but around 3 to 4 months is
  typical. Let the complexity of the problem space and potential solutions
  dictate how long the team spends on it. If the team is not confident at the
  end of the timeline, it may be wise to pause or to repeat discovery or
  conceptualisation.
</p>
<p>
  Product conceptualisation concludes when a prototype that is substantial
  enough to help the team make a decision about whether to invest in the agile
  development of an minimum viable product (MVP) is delivered.
</p>
<h3>Minimum viable product (MVP)</h3>
<p>
  An MVP is a platform with just enough features to test an idea out in the
  market with the purpose of learning quickly what works and what doesn’t. This
  allows the team to work out how to deliver the most business or customer value
  with the least amount of features.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Note that in constructing an MVP, frequent iterative releases are encouraged,
  where continuous feedback collected results in finetuning of user-centric
  design features and the technical infrastructure supporting it.
</p>
<p>Before starting work on the MVP, do find out if:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>There are better commercial / industry solutions</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>The potential impact does not justify the potential effort and cost</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Partner stakeholders are not able to run agile, user-centred practices
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Full-scale implementation is not viable from a policy, ops or service
      perspective
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Dependent agencies are not able to support the operationalisation of the
      solution
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the team is confident to move to beta, it is time to partner with the
  product, tech and business leads (and agency stakeholders) to work on a
  funding proposal.
</p>
<h3>Prioritisation matrix&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
  It is often useful to employ a
  <a
    href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-matrices/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    ><u>prioritisation matrix</u></a
  >
  to prioritise product features, and plan the project’s roadmap. A well-defined
  matrix also serves to bring stakeholders together in consensus on what is
  important for the team to work on, reducing the opportunities for future
  disputes.
