<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    The close integration of Design, Product and Engineering is critical for
    agile projects to succeed.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The project owner/product owner is committed to user centred practices and
  continuous iteration based on user research, prototyping, testing with real
  users.
</p>
<p>
  The collaboration model should be that Design, Product &amp; Engineering work
  as equals versus one reporting into the other.
</p>
<p>
  There is the commitment to resource designers, and design as a continuous work
  stream, throughout the entire project lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >There are three key phases of design throughout the digital project
    lifecycle:</strong
  >
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discovery</li>
  <li>Product Conceptualisation</li>
  <li>UX Design</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<h3>What is the Discovery Phase about?</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of discovery is to identify and understand the problem that needs
  to be solved, before committing to building a digital product or service. This
  means learning about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Potential users and what they are trying to achieve</li>
  <li>
    Any operations or technical constraints (e.g. existing processes, systems,
    legacy technology)
  </li>
  <li>The underlying policy intent that the government wants to implement</li>
  <li>Opportunities areas to create improvement or enable change</li>
</ul>
<p>
  What we learn through discovery will guide whether to move forward to product
  conceptualisation. It should not be an exercise to simply validate customer
  hypotheses or requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Example activities during discovery include user research, mapping and
  prioritising pain points, framing problem statements and opportunities,
  testing hypotheses, exploring alternatives to building a new digital product
  or service that could solve the problem more effectively.
</p>
<p>
  It is not a failure if the project does not proceed to product
  conceptualisation - if the research shows that the problem is better addressed
  via alternative solutions.
</p>
<h3>How long should a Discovery Phase take?</h3>
<p>
  There’s no set time period for discovery, but around 8 to 12 weeks is typical.
  Let the purpose of your discovery dictate how long the team spends on it.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re working on a problem that no one has researched before, you might
  need a bit longer. If it’s a problem and group of users that you know a fair
  bit about already, you might be able to get away with a slightly shorter
  discovery.
</p>
<h3>Deciding whether to move forward to Product Conceptualisation</h3>
<p>Do not proceed to product conceptualisation if:</p>
<blockquote>
  There is no compelling problem, opportunity or user need
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  There is no compelling argument for the Government to provide the digital
  product or service
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  User needs are already being well met by existing solutions
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Tech or policy constraints mean solution cannot be delivered anytime soon
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Partner stakeholders are not ready for user-centred practices
</blockquote>
<p>
  If you do decide to move on to product conceptualisation, you’ll need to make
  sure you:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Understand the wider context and overall service journey, and the other teams
  and organisations that could be working to address similar and related
  problems
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Are clear on how what you’re working on fits into that wider problem space and
  service journey
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Have a list of possible concepts that you’d like to test during product
  conceptualisation and an idea of which one you’d like to prototype first (and
  why)
</blockquote>
