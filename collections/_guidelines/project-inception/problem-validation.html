<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of discovery is to identify and understand the problem that needs
  to be solved, before committing to building a digital product or service. This
  means learning about:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Potential users and what they are trying to achieve</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any operations or technical constraints (e.g. existing processes, systems,
      legacy technology)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The underlying policy intent that the government wants to implement</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Opportunities areas to create improvement or enable change</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  What is gathered during discovery will help determine whether to move forward
  to

    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    ><u>product conceptualisation</u></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Note that <strong>developing a hypothesis</strong> and other fundamental
  research questions that define the identified problem is an important phase
  here. Strong interest by the public and key stakeholders in finding out
  answers to these questions will indicate the urgency and relevance of the
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>User research</strong> is crucial in this process, as it enables the team to understand
  their users’ lifestyles, habits and how they use or experience existing
  services, which results in a creation of a service that fits the users’ needs.
</p>
<p>
  Understand that it is not a failure if the project does not proceed to product
  conceptualisation - if the research shows that the problem is better addressed
  via alternative solutions.
</p>
<h4>Length of discovery</h4>
<p>
  There’s no set time period for discovery, but around 8 to 12 weeks is typical.
  Let the purpose and process of discovery dictate how long the team spends on
  it. It may take a little longer if the team is working on a problem that no
  one has researched before. If the problem and group of users is already well
  understood, the team might be able to get away with a slightly shorter
  discovery.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Do not proceed to product conceptualisation if:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>There is no compelling problem, opportunity or user need</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There is no compelling argument for the Government to provide the
        digital product or service
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>User needs are already being well met by existing solutions</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Tech or policy constraints mean solution cannot be delivered anytime
        soon
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Partner stakeholders are not ready for user-centred practices</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

      ><strong><u>product conceptualisation</u></strong></a
    ><strong>, teams must:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Understand the wider network context, or the other teams and
        organisations that could be working to address similar and related
        problems
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Have a list of possible concepts to test during product
        conceptualisation and an idea of which one to prototype first (and why)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Understand the reason for using technology as a solution. Many problems
        do not actually require technological solutions and many technological
        solutions need significant support from non-technological solutions
        (e.g. non-optimal business processes). Make sure that all stakeholders
        understand this.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  The further along a project is in terms of development, the more funding and
  KPIs will be locked in. Hence, it is essential that the proper due diligence
  is done during this problem validation phase to ensure that the project is a
  worthwhile one.
