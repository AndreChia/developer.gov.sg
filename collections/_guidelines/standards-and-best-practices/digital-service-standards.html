<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards">Digital
        Service Standards</a> (DSS) guide agencies in implementing their digital
    services to meet the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering
    digital services that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and
    businesses.</p>
<p>All public-facing digital services of the Government must meet the DSS. In
    addition, the Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS,
    to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently to meet the
    desired outcomes in DGB.</p>

<h2>Why DSS?</h2>
<p>To help public agencies design and deliver digital services that are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Accessible and Inclusive - Benefit different users, including the
            elderly and persons with special needs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Usable - Simple to understand and easy to use</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Relevant - Meeting the needs of users</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Principles</h2>
<h4>Intuitive Design and Usability</h4>
<p>Digital services designed according to the DSS will help users:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Identify, access and navigate a service easily</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Track and monitor transactions more efficiently</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Complete a transaction or interaction more effortlessly</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Accessibility and Inclusivity</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Perceivable - Ensure contents are available in forms such as speech,
            large print or Braille</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Operable - Ensure functions are accessible through a keyboard, mouse
            or other assistive devices</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Understable - Clear, concise content that avoids jargon</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Robust - Service can be accessed across devices</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Relevance and Consistency</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Adopt common design elements such as a standard masthead for a
            consistent user experience</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Conduct regular reviews to ensure contents and services are
            up-to-date</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Provide clear and relevant content</p>
    </li>
</ul>
