<h2>Instruction Manual for ICT & SS Management (IM8)</h2>

<p>
  Technological disruptions and evolutions have decisively changed global industries,
  economies, and our way of life. In this ongoing digital revolution, the Government
  must act quickly to seize its transformational potential and digitalise to improve
  service-delivery, operations, and policy-making in a secure and cost-effective
  manner. Government Agencies are responsible to operationalise requirements
  stipulated in the IM8. As owners of Government solutions and services, Government
  Agencies will define and implement the security and data protection requirements
  when using ICT&SS to deliver public services.
