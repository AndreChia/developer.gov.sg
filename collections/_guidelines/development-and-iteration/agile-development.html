<p>
  The values and principles of agile development come from the
  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    ><u>Agile Manifesto</u></a
  >. It encourages rapid iterative development with the objective of bringing
  flexibility and speed for projects and products. It promotes frequent
  adaptation and inspection which results in rapid delivery of high-quality
  solutions while constantly aligning product development with user
  requirements.

<h3>Scrum</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/img_agile-text.jpg" alt="Scrum workflow">
<p>
  At GovTech, cross-functional teams use Scrum to work together effectively.
  Scrum is a framework that guides teams in implementing an Agile way of
  working. It is based on empiricism, which states that decisions should be made
  based on what is known and what is known comes from experience and
  observation. This is the basis for the iterative and incremental nature of
  running digital projects - so that decisions can be based on results, rather
  than speculation or guesswork. For Scrum to work, there must be transparency,
  inspection and adaptation.
</p>
<p>
  A scrum team consists of a product owner, a scrum master and the development
  team. The scrum team is self-organising and self-managing, which means they
  decide how best to deliver their work, rather than being directed by someone
  outside the team. They are also cross-functional – all the skills or
  competencies required to do the work are within the team.
</p>
<h4>Product Owner</h4>
<p>
  The product owner should be someone with vision, authority and availability.
  The product owner needs to have a vision for how the product should develop
  and the authority to make decisions. They are also responsible for
  communicating the projects’ vision and priorities to the development team.
</p>
<p>
  The product owner ensures the team delivers maximum business value by
  prioritising and managing the product backlog.
</p>
<p>The product owner is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Writing the product backlog items clearly</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prioritising the product backlog items to achieve the most value and to
      meet the team’s goals
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Making sure the product backlog is visible, transparent, shows the team
      what to work on next and that the team understands the items
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect
      their decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product
      backlog item must go through the product owner. No one else should give
      the development team a different set of requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>The Scrum Master</h4>
<p>
  The scrum master ensures that Scrum is understood and practised by the product
  owner, the development team and the organisation. The role of scrum master
  does not have to be fixed - anyone in the development team can take up this
  role. This also highlights the importance of scrum being practised by every
  member of the team instead of being only a responsibility of the scrum master.
</p>
<p>
  The scrum master does this by ensuring the scrum team follows Scrum theory,
  practices and rules, and removing any obstacles the team encounters.
</p>
<p>The scrum master is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Facilitating daily scrum, sprint planning, sprint demo and retrospective
      meetings
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Forecasting the numbers of deliverables possible in an iteration, which is
      based on evidence and reliable source
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Creating useful, reliable and practical plans for software development
      projects
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Tracking and removing project impediments</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Product Backlog</h4>
<p>
  A product backlog is a living artefact and is never complete or finished. It
  evolves as the product and the environment change to ensure that the product
  is always appropriate, competitive and useful.
</p>
<p>
  The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog and
  arranging the items in order of priority.
</p>
<p>
  Usually, the items at the top of the product backlog are more detailed than
  the ones lower on the list. The product owner will work with the development
  team to add detail to the backlog items during product backlog refinement.
  Only items for the next 2–3 sprints are defined in greater detail. Items
  further down the list are expected to change by the time the team gets to
  them, so we don’t waste time refining them until we’re ready to work on them.
