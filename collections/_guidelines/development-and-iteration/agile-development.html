<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The values and principles of agile development come from
  the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.
</p>

<p>
  At GovTech, teams use Scrum to help our cross-functional teams work together
  effectively. Scrum is a framework that provides a guide to implementing
  an Agile way of working in an organisation. It is based on empiricism, which
  states that you should make decisions based on what you know and what you know
  comes from experience. That’s why our approach is iterative and incremental.
  So that we can make decisions based on results, rather than speculate or
  guess. For Scrum to work, there must be transparency, inspection and
  adaptation.
</p>
<p>
  A scrum team consists of a product owner, a scrum master and the development
  team. The scrum team is self-organising and self-managing, which means they
  decide how best to deliver their work, rather than being directed by someone
  outside the team. They are also cross-functional – all the skills or
  competencies required to do the work are within the team.

<h2>The Product Owner</h2>
<p>
  The product owner should be someone with vision, authority and availability.
  The product owner needs to have a vision for how the product should develop
  and the authority to make decisions. They are also responsible for
  communicating the vision and priorities to the development team.
</p>
<p>
  The product owner ensures the team delivers maximum business value by
  prioritising and managing the product backlog.
</p>
<p>The product owner is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing the product backlog items clearly</li>
  <li>
    Prioritising the product backlog items to achieve the most value and to meet
    the team’s goals
  </li>
  <li>
    Making sure the product backlog is visible, transparent, shows the team what
    to work on next and that the team understands the items
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
  decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog item
  must go through the product owner. No one else should give the development
  team a different set of requirements.
</p>

<h2>The Scrum Master</h2>
<p>
  The scrum master ensures that Scrum is understood and practiced by the product
  owner, the development team and the organisation.
</p>
<p>
  The scrum master does this by ensuring the scrum team follows Scrum theory,
  practices and rules, and removing any obstacles the team encounters.
</p>
<p>The scrum master is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Facilitating daily scrum, sprint planning, sprint demo and retrospective
    meetings
  </li>
  <li>
    Needs to forecast the numbers of deliverables possible in an iteration,
    which is based on evidence and reliable source
  </li>
  <li>
    Needs to be an expert in estimation and planning and knows how to create
    useful, reliable and practical plans for software development projects
  </li>
  <li>Ability to track and remove impediments</li>
  <li>Acts as safeguard for his team</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
  decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog item
  must go through the product owner. No one else should give the development
  team a different set of requirements.
</p>

<h2>The Development Team</h2>
<p>
  The development team is responsible for building the product or service.
  Usually there are about 7–8 people in the development team, which includes
  software engineers, quality engineers, architects, designers, business
  analysts and any other skills required to deliver the work. Ideally, the
  development team sits in the same room and are completely dedicated to the
  project.
</p>
<p>
  While each individual team member might have an area of specialisation or
  focus, the whole team is responsible and accountable for the work done. In
  order for the development team to be accountable, the organisation needs to
  empower them to organise and manage their own work.
</p>
<p>Here are some characteristics of a Development Team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Team members share the same norm and rules</li>
  <li>It is empowered and working as autonomous as it is possible</li>
  <li>The skills within the team are balanced</li>
  <li>It is small and has no sub-teams</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the product owner is to succeed, the organisation needs to respect their
  decisions and anyone wanting to change the priority of a product backlog item
  must go through the product owner. No one else should give the development
  team a different set of requirements.
</p>
<h2>Product Backlog</h2>
<p>
  A product backlog is a living artifact and is never complete or finished. It
  evolves as the product and the environment change to ensure that the product
  is always appropriate, competitive and useful.
</p>
<p>
  The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog and
  arranging the items in order of priority.
</p>
<p>
  Usually the items at the top of the product backlog are more detailed than the
  ones lower on the list. The product owner will work with the development team
  to add detail to the backlog items during product backlog refinement. Only
  items for the next 2–3 sprints are defined in greater detail. Items further
  down the list are expected to change by the time the team gets to them, so we
  don’t waste time refining them until we’re ready to work on them.
