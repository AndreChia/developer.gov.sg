<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  DevOps primarily involves a change in culture for teams, stressing the removal
  of barriers between the development and operations teams as well as high
  levels of communication.
</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Select tools that can measure the productivity of DevOps processes for
      continuous improvement. Relevant metrics has to be identified first,
      before automated processes to correct errors without human involvement can
      be defined.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Establish automated testing procedures to ensure that solutions are tested
      as early and frequently as possible. Part of the testing process should
      include the development of acceptable levels of the infrastructure,
      applications and data. It is important to make sure that the tests meet
      the acceptance criteria.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ensure constant application monitoring by using appropriate monitoring
      tools and instrumentation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use Infrastructure-as-Code, where the cloud’s API-driven model allows
      developers and IT personnel to interact with the infrastructure at scale
      instead of manually booting up and configuring resources.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Continuous Integrations, Testings and Deployments</h3>
<p>
  Continuous integration is an essential element in effective DevOps practice.
  Committing all code in a single repository is a useful foundation that can
  extend to other, more advanced practices. Moreover, the longer the development
  proceeds without merging back to the mainline, the higher the risk of multiple
  integration conflicts and failures of the eventual merger.
</p>
<p>
  Deployment automation allows applications to be deployed across the various
  environments used in the development process, as well as the final production
  environments. This results in
  <strong>faster, more frequent and more reliable deployments</strong>.
  Solutions that automate your deployment processes improve the productivity of
  both the Dev and Ops teams and enable them and the business to develop faster,
  accomplish more, and ultimately build better software that is deployed more
  frequently and functions more reliably for the end-user.
</p>
<p>
  CI/T/D helps to achieve this by automating the process of creating new builds,
  running tests and deploying them. It reduces the reliance on manual testing
  and frees up the team to concentrate on other tasks. Over time, CI/T/D can
  also highlight problematic areas and paint an overall picture of quality and
  stability.
</p>
<p>
  The chosen CI/T/D system should be capable of linking together the source
  control, build and testing tools employed by the team. A dashboard to display
  build progress and test results is also highly desirable. Lastly, the system
  should be configurable to target the desired deployment environment(s).

    is a product that provides services of a build pipeline for the whole of
    government. It provides managed services like Atlassian Bitbucket, Bamboo,
    Confluence, Jira to enable teams to build applications rapidly without
    having to worry about hardware costs and operations overheads of maintaining
    these services.

<p>Benefits of Deployment Automation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repeatability –</strong> Every deployment deploys the same</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Fewer errors –</strong> Removing manual steps reduces human error
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Anyone can deploy –</strong> eliminate bottlenecks by removing the
      need for experts to do the work
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Work on what matters –</strong> developers can spend time working
      on new features, not on fixes for manual deployments
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Customer satisfaction –</strong> frequent updates with new
      features addresses customer needs sooner and keeps organizations
      competitive
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Lower costs –</strong> fewer errors, fewer human hours needed for
      deployments means lower costs
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
