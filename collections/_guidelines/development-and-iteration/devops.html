<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
<p>
    DevOps emphasizes the removal of barriers to maintain high levels of communication between your
    development and operations teams. This usually results in a change of work culture within teams.
</p>
<h3>How can I ensure the effectiveness of my DevOps?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Select tools that can measure the productivity of DevOps processes for continuous
            improvement
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Identify relevant metrics before automated processes so errors found without human
            involvement can be defined
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Establish automated testing procedures to ensure that solutions are tested as early and
            frequently as possible. The testing process should include the development of acceptable
            levels of the infrastructure, applications and data
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Ensure constant application monitoring by using appropriate monitoring tools and
            instrumentation
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Use Infrastructure-as-Code, where the cloud’s API-driven model allows developers and IT
            personnel to interact with the infrastructure at scale instead of manually booting up
            and configuring resources
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the key components of DevOps?</h3>
<h4>Continuous Integration</h4>
<p>
    Continuous integration is an essential component in effective DevOps practice.
</p>
<p>
    Committing all code in a single repository is a useful foundation that can extend to more
    advanced practices.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, the longer the development proceeds without merging back to the mainline, the higher
    the risk of integration conflicts and failures in the eventual merge.
</p>

<h4>Deployments</h4>
<p>
    Deployment automation deploys applications across environments used in the development process
    and the final production environments. This results in faster, frequent and reliable
    deployments.
</p>
<p>
    Solutions that automate your deployment processes improve the productivity of both the Dev and
    Ops teams. Enabling your team to develop faster, accomplish more, and ultimately build reliable
    software for the end-user.
</p>

<h4>Testings</h4>
<p>
    CI/T/D helps to automate the process of creating new builds, running tests and deploying them.
    It reduces the reliance on manual testing and frees up the team to concentrate on other tasks.
    Over time, CI/T/D can also highlight problematic areas for you to enhance.
</p>
<p>
    The chosen CI/T/D system should link the source control, build and testing tools used by the
    team. A dashboard to display build progress and test results is also desirable. Lastly, the
    system should be configurable to target the desired deployment environment.
</p>

<h3>How can I benefit from CI/T/D?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Lower costs for you</strong> – fewer errors, fewer human hours needed for deployments means lower
            costs
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Fewer errors made</strong> – Removing manual steps reduces human error</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Higher customer satisfaction</strong> – frequent updates with new features addresses customer
            needs sooner and keeps organizations competitive
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Work on what matters</strong> – developers can spend time working on new features, not on fixes
            for manual deployments
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Anyone can deploy</strong> – eliminate bottlenecks by removing the need for experts to do the
            work
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Repeatability</strong> – Every deployment deploys the same</p>
    </li>
</ul>
