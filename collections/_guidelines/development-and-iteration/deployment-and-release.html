<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system
    available for use. </p>

<h3>Continuous Integrations, Testings and Deployments</h3>
<p>Deployment automation allows applications to be deployed across the various
    environments used in the development process, as well as the final
    production environments. This results in more efficient, reliable, and
    predictable deployments. Solutions that automate your deployment processes
    improve the productivity of both the Dev and Ops teams and enable them and
    the business to develop faster, accomplish more, and ultimately build better
    software that is deployed more frequently and functions more reliably for
    the end-user.</p>
<p>CI/T/D helps to achieve this by automating the process of creating new
    builds, running tests and deploying them. It reduces the reliance on manual
    testing and frees up the team to concentrate on other tasks. Over time,
    CI/T/D can also highlight problematic areas and paint an overall picture of
    quality and stability.</p>
<p>The chosen CI/T/D system should be capable of linking together the source
    control, build and testing tools employed by the team. A dashboard to
    display build progress and test results is also highly desirable. Lastly,
    the system should be configurable to target the desired deployment
    environment(s).</p>

            (Secure Hybrid Integrated Pipeline)</a> is a product that provides
        services of a build pipeline for the whole of government. It provides
        managed services like Atlassian Bitbucket, Bamboo, Confluence, Jira to
        enable teams to build applications rapidly without having to worry about
        hardware costs and operations overheads of maintaining these services.

<p>Benefits of Deployment Automation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Repeatability –</strong> Every deployment deploys the same
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Fewer errors –</strong> Removing manual steps reduces human
            error</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Anyone can deploy –</strong> eliminate bottlenecks by
            removing the need for experts to do the work</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Work on what matters –</strong> developers can spend time
            working on new features, not on fixes for manual deployments</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Customer satisfaction –</strong> frequent updates with new
            features addresses customer needs sooner and keeps organizations
            competitive</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Lower costs –</strong> fewer errors, fewer human hours needed
            for deployments means lower costs</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment Environment</h3>
<p>In software deployment, an environment is which a software component is
    deployed and executed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Development Environment -</strong> The development
            environment (dev) is the environment in which changes to software
            are developed, most simply an individual developer's workstation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Testing Environment -</strong> The purpose of the test
            environment is to allow human testers to exercise new and changed
            code via either automated checks or non-automated techniques.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Staging Environment -</strong> A stage or staging environment
            is an environment for testing that exactly resembles a production
            environment. It seeks to mirror an actual production environment as
            closely as possible and may connect to other production services and
            data, such as databases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Production Environment -</strong> Deploying to production is
            the most sensitive step; it may be done by deploying new code
            directly (overwriting old code, so only one copy is present at a
            time), or by deploying a configuration change.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
