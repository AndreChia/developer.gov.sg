<h2>UX Design</h2>
<h3>What is User Experience Design all about?</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of user experience design is to take responsibility for all
  aspects of the end-usersâ€™ interaction with a government service and its
  associated digital experiences. It starts with the gathering of user insights,
  its translation into the design and implementation of user interactions,
  content, interfaces and processes, but can stretch to reimagining entire
  service journeys to make them simpler, more human-centred and more impactful.
  This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Designing how people will interact with a digital product or service, and
    how to elicit the desired user behaviours and outcomes
  </li>
  <li>
    Defining how information should be structured, the relationships between
    different types of content and making it easy to navigate
  </li>
  <li>
    Defining how the presentation layers of a product or service look, to
    elevate the user experience, usability and engagement
  </li>
  <li>
    Running usability testing to identify friction, inform design iteration and
    qualify improvements
  </li>
  <li>
    Making sure everyone can use the digital service by testing for
    accessibility and addressing usability challenges that might lead to people
    being unintentionally excluded
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is about supporting the agile development of the digital product or service
  in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements informed
  by user research, testing and product data. It should not be an exercise to
  simply deliver on user stories.
</p>
<p>
  Example activities include close collaboration with product owners, product
  managers, software engineers, quality engineers, etc., delivery of
  low-fidelity to high-fidelity design assets as appropriate throughout the
  agile sprint cycle and balancing the short term need to deliver on the product
  backlog with the need to look ahead at how user needs are changing and how the
  user experience needs to evolve to meet those changing needs.
