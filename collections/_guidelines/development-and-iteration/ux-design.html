<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of user experience design is to take responsibility for all
  aspects of the end-users’ interaction with government services and its
  associated digital experiences. It starts with the gathering of user insights,
  its translation into the design and implementation of user interactions,
  content, interfaces and processes, but can stretch to reimagining entire
  service journeys to make them simpler, more human-centred and more impactful.
  This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Designing how people will interact with a digital product or service, and
      how to elicit the desired user behaviours and outcomes
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Defining how information should be structured, the relationships between
      different types of content and making it easy to navigate
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Defining how the presentation layers of a product or service look, to
      elevate the user experience, usability and engagement
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Running usability testing to identify friction, inform design iteration
      and identify improvements
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Making sure everyone can use the digital service by testing for
      accessibility and addressing usability challenges that might lead to
      people being unintentionally excluded
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  UX design is about supporting the agile development of the digital product or
  service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements
  informed by user research, testing and product data. It should not be an
  exercise to simply deliver on user stories.
</p>
<h3>UX design domains</h3>
<p>
  UX designers typically leverage on a broad collection of design skills and
  experiences that together support the development of great user experiences.
  In reality, no two UX designers are exactly alike - there are
  design-generalists who have a broad base of competencies; others are
  design-specialists with a depth of expertise in select competency areas; some
  excel at craft and individual contribution, others excel at leading
  multi-disciplinary product teams and stakeholder engagement.
</p>
<p>
  Roles also differ due to team size. On smaller teams, one UX designer is
  usually sufficient to cover all bases - a design-generalist who can cater to
  all potential UX needs. Larger teams with more resources may divide their
  design team into more specific roles. They might distinguish between design
  researchers, interaction designers, content strategists and service designers.
  Bigger organisations may also have more variation in terms of leadership
  skills and domain expertise.
</p>
<p>
  In assembling the product team, it worth spending the time to think through
  and articulate the specific design skills and deliverables required and the
  phase of the project lifecycle the project is currently in (discovery, product
  conceptualisation, agile development, etc.)
</p>
<p>
  The whole team, and in particular the designers, user researchers, content
  designers and developers, must work together to design, build and iterate a
  service based on user needs
</p>
