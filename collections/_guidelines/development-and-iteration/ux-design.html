  The purpose of user experience design is to take responsibility for all
  aspects of the end-users’ interaction with government services and its
  associated digital experiences. It starts with the gathering of user insights,
  its translation into the design and implementation of user interactions,
  content, interfaces and processes, but can stretch to reimagining entire
  service journeys to make them simpler, more human-centred and more impactful.
  This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Designing how people will interact with a digital product or service, and
      how to elicit the desired user behaviours and outcomes
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Defining how information should be structured, the relationships between
      different types of content and making it easy to navigate
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Defining how the presentation layers of a product or service look, to
      elevate the user experience, usability and engagement
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Running usability testing to identify friction, inform design iteration
      and qualify improvements
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Making sure everyone can use the digital service by testing for
      accessibility and addressing usability challenges that might lead to
      people being unintentionally excluded
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  UX design is about supporting the agile development of the digital product or
  service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements
  informed by user research, testing and product data. It should not be an
  exercise to simply deliver on user stories.
</p>
<p>
  Example activities include close collaboration with product owners, product
  managers, software engineers, quality engineers, etc., delivery of
  low-fidelity to high-fidelity design assets as appropriate throughout the
  agile sprint cycle and balancing the short term need to deliver on the product
  backlog with the need to look ahead at how user needs are changing and how the
  user experience needs to evolve to meet those changing needs.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout this process, it is important to allow the team to self-organise
  and take autonomy in trying out new roles, methods and resources they perceive
  will improve efficiency and collaboration. Some methods to cultivate this
  includes:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Including the team in all stages of a project life cycle. This enables the
      team to understand the product’s start-to-finish context to drive more
      targeted solutions and enhance a sense of accountability.&nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Encouraging team members to offer suggestions to each other, even in areas
      that are not their specialisation (e.g. an engineer giving ideas to a UX
      designer). This can spur fresh, innovative and interdisciplinary eureka
      moments and solutions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  At the same time, it is key to encourage the team to be unafraid to fail.
  Failures often reveal key mistakes and motivates the team to learn and
  re-learn. Often, it is only through rock-bottom scenarios that provide
  important lessons that the project can head north again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Product humility is another important virtue for success. Team members should
  be reminded to refrain from perceiving their product or idea as the best, or
  the only feasible solution. Openness to fresh ideas and implementation methods
  is key for improvement.
