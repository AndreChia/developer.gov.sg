<h3>Definition of Done</h3>
<p>
  In scrum, each increment developed by the team should be shippable by the end
  of the sprint. This means that new features can be deployed at any time.
</p>
<p>
  It is up to each team to define what needs to be completed before an increment
  is shipped. The team uses these requirements to develop a definition of
  ‘done’. That way everyone has the same understanding of what ‘done’ is. For
  example, a team may define as ‘done’ as code that has passed all automated
  tests, been integrated, and fulfilled all user story requirements. This often
  means having the business unit or UX designers themselves taking part in the
  process of publishing a feature as ‘done’.
</p>
<h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
<p>
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves quick cycles of testing, coding and
  refactoring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write an automated test case for a new function or an improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Produce the least amount of code to pass the test</p></li>
  <li><p>Refactor the code until it is as simple and clean as possible</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  TDD helps ensure the quality of code because it naturally verifies that the
  code written behaves as intended.
</p>
<p>
  If something goes wrong, there are only a few lines of code to check and fix.
  More importantly, all the tests written by the team are run with every build
  for assurance that the codebase continues to work as intended.
</p>
<p>
  When a test fails, there also has to be a feedback mechanism to alert the
  development team. For instance, teams can use a common monitor visible to all
  members displaying the latest status of builds. Chatbots are useful here as
  well for push notifications.
