<h3>Definition of Done</h3>
<p>
  Each increment developed by the team needs to shippable by the end of the
  sprint. This means that new features can be deployed at any time.
</p>
<p>
  Different organisations have different requirements for what needs to be
  completed before an increment is shipped. The team uses these requirements to
  develop the definition of ‘done’. That way everyone has the same understanding
  of what ‘done’ is.
</p>
<h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
<p>
  Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves quick cycles of testing, coding and
  refactoring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write an automated test case for a new function or an improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Produce the least amount of code to pass the test</p></li>
  <li><p>Refactor the code until it is as simple and clean as possible</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  TDD helps ensure the quality of your code because it verifies that the code
  you write does what you intend it to do.
</p>
<p>
  If something goes wrong, there are only a few lines of code to check and fix.
  More importantly, all the tests written by the team are run with every build,
  so you can be sure the code continues to work as intended.
</p>
<p>
  If someone accidentally breaks the code, the tests fail. At GovTech, when a
  test fails, it’s immediately highlighted on our big screens until that person
  manages to fix the problem.
