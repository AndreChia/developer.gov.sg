<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system
  available for use. The general deployment process consists of several
  interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These
  activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both.

<h3>Deployment Automation</h3>
<p>
  Deployment automation allows applications to be deployed across the various
  environments used in the development process, as well as the final production
  environments. This results in more efficient, reliable, and predictable
  deployments. Solutions that automate your deployment processes improve the
  productivity of both the Dev and Ops teams and enable them and the business to
  develop faster, accomplish more, and ultimately build better software that is
  deployed more frequently and functions more reliably for the end-user.

<blockquote>
  SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integrated Pipeline) is a product that provides services
  of a build pipeline for the whole of government. It provides managed services
  like Atlassian Bitbucket, Bamboo, Confluence, Jira to enable teams to build
  applications rapidly without having to worry about hardware costs and
  operations overheads of maintaining these services.

<p>Benefits of Deployment Automation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Repeatability –</b> Every deployment deploys the same</li>
  <li><b>Fewer errors –</b> Removing manual steps reduces human error</li>
  <li>
    <b>Anyone can deploy –</b> eliminate bottlenecks by removing the need for
    experts to do the work
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Work on what matters –</b> developers can spend time working on new
    features, not on fixes for manual deployments
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Customer satisfaction –</b> frequent updates with new features addresses
    customer needs sooner and keeps organizations competitive
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Lower costs –</b> fewer errors, fewer human hours needed for deployments
    means lower costs
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment Environment</h3>
<p>
  In software deployment, an environment is which a software component is
  deployed and executed.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Development Environment -</b> The development environment (dev) is the
    environment in which changes to software are developed, most simply an
    individual developer's workstation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Testing Environment -</b> The purpose of the test environment is to allow
    human testers to exercise new and changed code via either automated checks
    or non-automated techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Staging Environment -</b> A stage or staging environment is an
    environment for testing that exactly resembles a production environment. It
    seeks to mirror an actual production environment as closely as possible and
    may connect to other production services and data, such as databases.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Production Environment -</b> Deploying to production is the most
    sensitive step; it may be done by deploying new code directly (overwriting
    old code, so only one copy is present at a time), or by deploying a
    configuration change.
  </li>
</ul>
