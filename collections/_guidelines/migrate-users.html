<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  There are many challenges in moving to new software platforms without major
  customer losses. These software moves are usually prompted by the need to
  sunset an acquired product or replace a legacy product with a new one.
</p>

<h2>Planning a Successful Migration</h2>
<p>Here are the steps to plan a successful migration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Know who are customers of your current offerings -</b> Understand levels
    of usage, use cases and any integrated products. Recognize the costs
    invested in the current offering.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Segment your customer base by usage level and migration costs-</b> Make a
    detailed list of each segment’s concerns.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Create a plan for each segment -</b> Take into account customers'
    concerns, costs and timeline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Focus on the biggest customers first -</b> Sometimes, a small portion of
    the customer base provides 80 percent of revenue. Contact those customers
    individually, in person or by phone, to communicate the migration plan and
    ask for feedback. Conducting this conversation via email is not recommended.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Explain how new offering is better than current -</b> Be honest about any
    shortfalls or features that are no longer available. Describe the benefits
    of open software access, ready availability of new versions, and additional
    flexibility in features and perhaps cost.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Create content that focus on customers' concerns -</b> If customers worry
    that migration will be difficult, create reference stories from customers
    that have already migrated. If customers’ employees fear the change, bring
    in change management expertise to allay their fears.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Define the dates -</b> Set an end-of-life date for the current product
    and the moving date for the new product.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Train front-line employees on the migration -</b> Be sure they can easily
    answer questions on why the current offering is being discontinued and how
    to migrate to the new offering.
  </li>
</ul>
