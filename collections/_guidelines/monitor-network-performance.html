<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Network monitoring is a critical IT function that has a wide range of benefits
  for businesses of all sizes. It can save money in network performance,
  employee productivity and infrastructure costs, and it is far more strategic
  than its name implies. It involves watching and reporting on problems 24/7,
  but it's also about optimising data flow and access in a complex and changing
  environment.
</p>
<p>
  A network monitoring system can help find solutions to a wide range of
  problems including slow webpage downloads, lost e-mail, questionable user
  activity and file delivery caused by overloaded, crashed servers, and issues
  with network connections.
</p>
<p>
  Virtually any kind of network can be monitored. It doesn't matter whether it's
  wireless or wired, a corporate LAN, VPN or service provider WAN. You can
  monitor devices on different operating systems with a multitude of functions,
  ranging from smartphones to servers, routers and switches.
