<h3>Hiring</h3>
<p>
  The most effective way to cultivate a specific team culture is to hire
  individuals that fit the teamâ€™s desired mindset and practices. A healthy team
  consists of individuals who share common visions and motivations, and work
  effectively towards the same goals.
</p>

<h3>The environment for effective teams</h3>
<p>
  Effective teams stay cohesive over time and experience high satisfaction with
  with the meaning and impact their work. As a result, such teams often do not
  need strict rules restricting their actions. They often take the initiative to
  innovate and find ways to make meaningful contributions.

    >Several key factors</a
  >
  contribute to an environment that is conducive for effective teams.
</p>

<h4>Psychological safety</h4>

<p>
  Psychological safety is a fundamental aspect of an effective team's
  environment. It refers to how much perceived risk there is in saying or doing
  something different in a team without the potential for embarassment or
  punishment. With a high level of psychological safety, team members readily
  offer each other ideas, ask questions or admit mistakes.
</p>

<h4>Dependability</h4>
<p>
  Team members produce quality work, and trust each other to produce quality
  work. Poorly implemented features and recurring, low-effort bugs are examples
  of things that can impact dependability within a team.
</p>

<h4>Structure and clarity</h4>
<p>
  Team members understand the expectations of their jobs as well as how to
  achieve them. These expectations should be clear and offer a challenge.
</p>

<h4>Meaning</h4>
<p>
  The process of work and its output should be meaningful for team members. This
  meaning can come from different places depending on the team member.
</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
<p>
  The perception that a team's work is making a difference and contributing to
  the team's goals.
