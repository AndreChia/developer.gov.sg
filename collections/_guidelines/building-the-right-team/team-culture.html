<h2>How can I create a good Team culture?</h2>
<p>
    The most effective way to cultivate a specific team culture is to hire individuals that fit your
    company culture.
</p>
<p>
    A healthy team consists of individuals who share common team values, goals and motivations, and
    work towards them.
</p>
<h3>How can I create effective Teams?</h3>
<p>
    Effective teams stay united and are satisfied with the impact of their work. As a result, such
    teams often do not need strict rules. They often take the initiative to innovate and find ways
    to make meaningful contributions.

        Several key factors</a
    >
    contribute to a conducive environment for effective teams.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Psychological safety</strong>
        <p>
            Psychological safety is a fundamental aspect of an effective team's environment. It
            refers to how much risk there is in saying or doing something different in a team,
            without repercussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a high level of psychological safety, team members readily offer each other ideas,
            ask questions or admit mistakes.
