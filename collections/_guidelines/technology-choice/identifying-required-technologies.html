<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  The technical decisions decisions we make must enable the team to work
  efficiently and allow deployed services to scale easily and cost-effectively.
</p>
<p>
  Start by determining if the technology stack is suitable for the
  product/service being developed. Understand what the intended use cases are
  and which target platforms to support. Additionally, consider the maturity of
  the technology, the level of support available and how well it integrates with
  other technologies.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever possible, teams should consider using open-source, commodity
  solutions across their technology stack, especially if these technologies have
  widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise
  technology companies.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, have the team weigh in on the chosen technologies and determine if
  there is enough expertise and experience on the team to adopt it.
</p>

<h2>Flexible Hosting Environment</h2>
<p>
  This step is about selecting a host that has flexible infrastructure, where
  resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user
  demand. Data classification and usage patterns will likely play a big part in
  the choice of the host.
</p>
<p>
  Cloud based hosting is suitable if the data is not classified and the service
  needs to be available publicly whereas government data centres and on-premise
  infrastructure are best suited for handling sensitive data or if the service
  needs to be available internally.
</p>
<blockquote>
  GCC (Government Commercial Cloud) Infrastructure is designed to manage all the
  resources hosted on the commercial service providers, in the likes of Amazon
  Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. With the GCC,
  the government would be able to significantly transform the way they develop
  software and applications.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Hybrid solutions can also be an option. Ideally, the chosen host should
  support secure remote monitoring and administration so maintenance can be
  carried out easily.
</p>
<p>
  Development teams also need to consider how many deployment environments are
  required. For example, web services typically employ 3 distinct environments
  to cater for ‘development’, ’staging’ and ‘production’. It is best to keep
  them on the same host to reduce possible issues with compatibility.
</p>

<h2>Continuous Integrations, Testings and Deployments</h2>
<p>
  This step is to find out how to bring testing in line with the pace of
  development and delivery without sacrificing quality.
</p>
<p>
  CI/T/D helps to achieve this by automating the process of creating new builds,
  running tests and deploying them. It reduces the reliance on manual testing
  and frees up the team to concentrate on other tasks. Over time, CI/T/D can
  also highlight problematic areas and paint an overall picture of quality and
  stability.
</p>
<p>
  The chosen CI/T/D system should be capable of linking together the source
  control, build and testing tools employed by the team. A dashboard to display
  build progress and test results is also highly desirable. Lastly, the system
  should be configurable to target the desired deployment environment(s).
</p>
<blockquote>
  <a href="" target="_blank">SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integrated Pipeline)</a> is a
  product that provides services of a build pipeline for the whole of
  government. It provides managed services like Atlassian Bitbucket, Bamboo,
  Confluence, Jira to enable teams to build applications rapidly without having
  to worry about hardware costs and operations overheads of maintaining these
  services.
</blockquote>

<h2>Manage Security and Privacy</h2>
<p>
  This step is about protecting sensitive information of our digital services
  and keeping systems secure.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to consider security and privacy aspects at every stage of
  development and deployment. At the start of designing a new service or
  product, the team lead should engage appropriate privacy, security and legal
  consultants to determine the security classification of the project, what
  information needs to be collected/accessed, how it is secured, how long it is
  kept and how it will be used and shared. Once this is determined, the
  appropriate security aspects needs to be designed into the overall system on
  both the infrastructure and software level.
</p>
<p>
  During day-to-day-operations. the team should consider incorporating scanning
  tools to automate the detection of software vulnerabilities and malware as
  part of the CI/T/D pipeline. The team should also plan to conduct regular
  security checks and audits to ensure system integrity.
