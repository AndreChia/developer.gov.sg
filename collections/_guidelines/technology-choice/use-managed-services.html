<h2>What is Managed Services?</h2>
<p>
    Managed Services are IT solutions for your team to improve efficiency and reduce the costs of
    your business.
</p>

<h3>What are some examples available for me?</h3>
<p>
    Commercial Cloud Services and Government Managed Services are some managed IT services you can
    adopt.
</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of Commercial Cloud Services?</h3>
<p>
    We encourage you to adopt solutions by commercial cloud providers. If you are a public servant,
    you can consider using

        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        >Government Commercial Cloud</a>.
</p>
<p>Cloud adoption brings you many benefits. This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Improved IT Delivery and Ops</strong>
        <p>
            You can enjoy a reduction in development time, day-to-day support and maintenance&nbsp;
            (e.g. using Infra as Code or CI/CD implementation).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Flexible infrastructure</strong>
        <p>
            With cloud services, you can scale up or down your hosting resources on demand.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Increased Agility</strong>
        <p>
            You can rapidly deploy application updates and react to increased service demand or
            security threats.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Better Security</strong>
        <p>
            Cloud service providers offer you robust security features and internationally
            recognised certifications that would be a challenge for any single organisation to
            deliver on its own.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the benefits of Government Managed Services?</h3>
<p>

    teams can leverage on. You can now save your team time and effort from building tools
    from scratch. Some of these include:
