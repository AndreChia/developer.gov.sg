<h3>Commercial cloud services</h3>
<p>
  Unless prohibited, consider using solutions by commercial cloud providers
  first. Usage of commercial cloud providers is done through the
  <a href="/technologies/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-commercial-cloud"
    >Government Commercial Cloud</a
  >.
</p>
<p>Cloud adoption results in numerous benefits, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>IT Delivery and Ops</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Improved IT delivery/deployment (e.g. reduction in development time
          and/or reduction in day-to-day support and maintenance e.g. using
          Infra as Code or CI/CD implementation)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible infrastructure</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          With cloud services, you can scale up or down your hosting resources
          on demand.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agility</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          With practically every service offering automation and seconds-only
          deployment, it is possible to rapidly deploy application updates and
          react to increased service demand or security threats.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cloud service providers offer robust security features and
          internationally recognized certifications that would be a challenge
          for anyone organization to deliver on its own.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
