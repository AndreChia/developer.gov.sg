<h2>
    Where possible, we recommend that your team use Open-source software (OSS).
</h2>
<p>
    What are the advantages of Open-source software? OSS brings you
    <strong>benefits</strong> such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Leveraging on well-tested code and software</p></li>
    <li><p>Potential savings in licensing and maintenance fees</p></li>
    <li><p>Higher resource familiarity and use</p></li>
    <li><p>Easier adoption and easier hiring</p></li>
    <li><p>Support is easily available in online communities</p></li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Lower barriers for new innovations and the re-contribution of knowledge and resources
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Teams should note however that there are also costs associated with the usage of OSS - primarily
    manpower and migration costs.
