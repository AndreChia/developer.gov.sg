<h2>Factors to consider during a project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conventions for products of a similar nature</li>
  <li>Legal requirements</li>
  <li>Policy requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Not understanding regulations and expectations that come with any project can
  result in delays or even heavy costs associated with necessary changes
  discovered after various decisions have been made.
</p>
<p>
  It is the responsibility of the product owners and development teams to
  understand the policies and rules that they have to follow
</p>
<p>
  Understand technical decisions and the reasons behind them. Guide decisions
  using principles instead of what feels easy. Instead of committing to heavy
  engineering straight away, it is important to understand the tools available,
  whether they be free, commercially available or already built by another team
  within the organisation.
