<p>
  Not understanding regulations and expectations that come with any project can
  result in delays or even heavy costs associated with necessary changes
  discovered after various decisions have been made.
</p>

<p>Examples of factors to consider while carrying out a project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conventions for products of a similar nature</li>
  <li>Legal requirements</li>
  <li>Policy requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is the responsibility of the product owners and development teams to
  understand the policies and rules that affect the services they are building.
</p>

<h3>Understand technical decisions</h3>

<p>
  Developers and architect must understand technical decisions made and the
  reasons behind them, and guide decisions using principles instead of what
  feels easy. Instead of committing to full-scale engineering straight away, it
  is also important to understand the tools and software already available,
  whether they be free, commercially available or already built by another team
  within the organisation.
