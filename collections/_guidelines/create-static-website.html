<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>A static informational website typically only consists of HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript files to be served to clients, such as a desktop or mobile web
    browser. It is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored. Since a
    server-side technology is not required to dynamically generate content,
    static websites are relatively straightforward to build and deploy.</p>
