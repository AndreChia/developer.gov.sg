<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards">Digital
        Service Standards</a> (DSS) guide agencies in implementing their digital
    services to meet the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering
    digital services that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and
    businesses.</p>
<p>All public-facing digital services of the Government must meet the DSS. In
    addition, the Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS,
    to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently to meet the
    desired outcomes in DGB.</p>

<h4>Why DSS?</h4>
<p>To help public agencies design and deliver digital services that are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Accessible and Inclusive - Benefit different users, including the
            elderly and persons with special needs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Usable - Simple to understand and easy to use</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Relevant - Meeting the needs of users</p>
    </li>
</ul>
