    Dynamic sites have their content updated often, and often come with user interfaces
    geared towards content writing and publishing. Examples include CMS, blogs and 
    informational websites.

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  Whether you are building a
  <a href="/workflows/construction-iteration/create-static-website/"
    >static information</a
  >, dynamic information or <a href="">transactional website</a>, we have tools
  to support your development.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Dynamic Informational Website</h4>
<p>
  Dynamic sites are blogs, e-commerce sites, calendar or to-do sites, or any
  site that needs to updated often.
</p>
<p>
  Dynamic sites use languages like PHP to interact with information stored in a
  databases. For this reason, dynamic sites are much more complicated and
  expensive to create. Not only is web hosting required, but databases or
  servers must be created as well. The languages used to create dynamic sites
  are also much more complicated than the client-side languages.

<h4>Content Website Platform</h4>
<p>
  To support the government agencies in improving the digital shopfront and the
  user experience, GovTech introduced a common hosting platform for government
  websites, called the Content Websites Platform (CWP).
</p>
<blockquote>
  The CWP is a common secured environment based on a resilient, robust and
  controlled platform which provides a suite of standardised software for
  hosting content-based websites. It enables unclassified government websites to
  be centrally managed and operated on public cloud, bringing the benefits of
  convenience, greater security, optimisation of resources, faster deployment
  speed and cost savings through economies of scale.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The idea behind CWP is to improve the government’s digital shopfront
  experience and help organisations build websites within significantly reduced
  timeframes. CWP accomplishes that by leveraging public cloud technology and
  putting together a stack of services, around not just hosting, but also
  security and operations management.
</p>
<p>
  Traditionally, each agency built everything from the ground up. In the data
  centre approach, they were responsible for the everything, from storage
  through servers, virtualisation, operating system (O/S), middleware and
  runtime to services and the website itself.
</p>
<p>
  In the private cloud approach, parts of the stack are managed for the agency
  but the agency is still responsible for at least half the stack.
</p>
<p>
  With the CWP, the agencies only have to manage their own websites and they can
  focus on delivering the best possible user experience. Everything else is
  handled for them by GovTech.
</p>
<br />
<h6>Hosting Environment</h6>
<p>
  CWP is hosted in the Public Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and G-Cloud,
  IM8[1] Compliant Hosting Environment, for the ‘unclassified’ front-end website
  and ‘restricted’ form services respectively.
</p>
<p>
  CWP offers two categories of services, Base Services and Catalogue Buy
  Services. Base Services include virtual hosting environment services (AWS) and
  Form services (G-Cloud or Government Cloud) and bundled security
  infrastructure services; and security management services.
</p>
<p>
  Agencies can choose from 3 website tiers for the virtual hosting environment
  services: Small (Website page views of 50,000 per day and website data
  transfer of 5GB), Medium (Website page views of 200,000 per day and website
  data transfer of 20GB), and Large (Website page views of 800,000 per day and
  website data transfer of 5GB).
</p>
<p>
  There are similar categories for Form Services with small, medium and large
  for form traffic of 200, 400 and 800 per day respectively.
</p>
<br />
<h6>Integrated, Centrally-Managed Security</h6>
<p>
  CWP centrally manages the security protection of all hosted websites, through
  a range of integrated security infrastructure and management services.
</p>
<p>
  At the perimeter, measures comprise: 1) CyberWatch Centre, which captures and
  processes security alerts; 2) Content Delivery Network (CDN) for caching and
  distributing load; 3) Web application firewall to filter malicious web
  traffic; and 4) Defacement monitoring, which monitors webpages against
  unauthorised changes.
</p>
<p>
  There is another layer of security which includes Virtual Private Cloud to
  protect cloud resources; End Point Protection against viruses and malware;
  Network Intrusion Protection System to examine network traffic flows and block
  exploits; Patch Management for monitoring and administering timely software
  patches, fixes and updates; and Cert Management for managing SSL/ TSL[2]
  certificates.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, vulnerability assessment is conducted annually for application
  software/ customer website and on a quarterly basis for the Operating system,
  Database management system and the Network infrastructure. Both automatic and
  manual Penetration Testing is done once a year.
</p>
<p>
  All of this is integrated as part of the basic services package. The agencies
  don’t have to go around shopping to find security solutions. In addition, CWP
  leverages multiple availability zones[3] of AWS in Singapore, adding another
  layer of resiliency.
</p>
<br />
<h6>Content Publishing Services</h6>
<p>
  This falls under the ‘Catalogue Buy Services’. (Catalogue Buy also includes a
  range of miscellaneous services, such as additional website traffic, form
  traffic, data storage; invoice options; urgent service requests; and
  performance test tools.)
</p>
<p>
  CWP provides improved manageability and operational efficiency with five
  Content Management Systems (CMS) standardised software. Customer may bring
  their own CMS licenses over to CWP provided the licensing scheme is supported
  in CWP. Alternatively, customer may procure the CMS licenses in CWP. They can
  choose to deploy HTML websites where CMSes are not required.
</p>
<p>
  The five supported CMSes are WordPress which is Open Source (with commercial
  support for plug-ins) and four proprietary CMSes, namely SharePoint, SiteCore,
  Swiit and Sitefinity.
</p>
<br />
<h6>Simple Process for Agencies</h6>
<p>
  Agencies developing and deploying websites through CWP follow a simple 4-step
  process. GovTech has developed self-service portals for Service, Deployment,
  Security, Utilisation, User management, operations and service desk.
</p>
<p>
  The requester goes on to the Service portal and signs up for an account. Once
  the account is approved, the requester can subscribe for the tier of service
  they want. After provisioning for the staging and production environment, the
  developer can start deploying their codes through the Deployment portal and
  then conduct user testing.
</p>
<p>
  This is followed by booking and running security tests through the Security
  portal. Once vulnerability and penetration testing is completed, the security
  findings verified and any loopholes remediated, the agencies can deploy the
  website and go live.
