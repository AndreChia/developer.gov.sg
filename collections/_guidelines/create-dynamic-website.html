description: Dynamic sites have their content updated often, and often come with user interfaces geared towards content writing and publishing. Examples include CMS, blogs and  informational websites.

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Dynamic sites are blogs, e-commerce sites, calendar or to-do sites, or any
    site that needs to updated often.</p>
<p>Dynamic sites use languages like PHP to interact with information stored in a
    databases. For this reason, dynamic sites are much more complicated and
    expensive to create. Not only is web hosting required, but databases or
    servers must be created as well. The languages used to create dynamic sites
    are also much more complicated than the client-side languages.</p>

<h4>Content Website Platform</h4>
<p>To support the government agencies in improving the digital shopfront and the
    user experience, GovTech introduced a common hosting platform for government
    websites, called the Content Websites Platform (CWP).</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The CWP is a common secured environment based on a resilient, robust and
        controlled platform which provides a suite of standardised software for
        hosting content-based websites. It enables unclassified government
        websites to be centrally managed and operated on public cloud, bringing
        the benefits of convenience, greater security, optimisation of
        resources, faster deployment speed and cost savings through economies of
        scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea behind CWP is to improve the governmentâ€™s digital shopfront
    experience and help organisations build websites within significantly
    reduced timeframes. CWP accomplishes that by leveraging public cloud
    technology and putting together a stack of services, around not just
    hosting, but also security and operations management.</p>
<p>Traditionally, each agency built everything from the ground up. In the data
    centre approach, they were responsible for the everything, from storage
    through servers, virtualisation, operating system (O/S), middleware and
    runtime to services and the website itself.</p>
<p>In the private cloud approach, parts of the stack are managed for the agency
    but the agency is still responsible for at least half the stack.</p>
<p>With the CWP, the agencies only have to manage their own websites and they
    can focus on delivering the best possible user experience. Everything else
    is handled for them by GovTech.</p>

<h4>Customisation</h4>
<p>Content Management System themes for CWP have been constructed with UI
    Components from the <a href="https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/">Singapore
        Government Design System</a>, developed and maintain by GovTech.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/">Design System</a> is a
        collection of reusable component, guided by clear standards, that can be
        assembled together to build any number of applications that comply to <a
            href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/">Digital
            Service Standards</a>.</p>
