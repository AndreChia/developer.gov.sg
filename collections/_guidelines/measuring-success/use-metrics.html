<h2>What is Use Metrics? Why is it important to me?</h2>
<p>
    To determine the success of your project, it is important to make use of quantifiable metrics
    measurement. Fortunately, the rise of analytics allows your development teams to easily collect
    data. This helps you to track whether your projects are fulfilling performance metrics.

<h3>How can I set goals for my team?</h3>
<p>
    Developing <a href="https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">
        <u>OKRs</u></a> (Objectives and Key Results) is useful for setting, tracking and re-evaluating goals 
        for your team.
</p>
<p>
    This ensures all your team members are heading in the same direction to achieve targeted goals
    and KPIs.
</p>
<p>
    If a project falls short of achieving the goals; or is unsustainable in terms of money or time,
    you consider retiring it. Don't be too dejected when that happens, learn from the mistakes.
    And if possible, reuse previous technologies for improved proficiency in your new projects.
</p>
<h3>What should I be measuring?</h3>
<p>
    Besides external metrics (i.e. those set by management), your team should also develop internal
    (i.e. self-defined) metrics.
</p>
<p>
    More importantly, factors that are meaningful and relevant to users should be identified as
    metric KPIs.
</p>
<p>
    Quantifiable metrics are useful for visualisable monitoring. It allows for the measurement of
    the team’s final delivery and productivity. Customer satisfaction, adoption rate and conversion
    rate are some examples of widely-used metrics.

    Data sources should include - the cost of hosting transactions or qualitative feedback like user satisfaction.
