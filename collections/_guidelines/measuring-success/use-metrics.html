  In order to determine the success of a project or product, it is important to
  make use of quantifiable metrics, especially in modern (i.e. internet)
  environments that allow development teams to easily collect data that tells
  them whether their projects are fulfilling their objectives.
</p>
<h3>What to measure</h3>
<p>
  While external metrics (i.e. those set by management) should be considered, it
  is useful for the team to develop internal (i.e. self-defined) metrics too.
  Particularly, factors that are meaningful and relevant to users should be
  identified as metric KPIs.
</p>
<p>
  Customer satisfaction, adoption rate and conversion are some examples of
  widely-used metrics.

    Government development teams can make use of
    <a href="/technologies/analytics/wogaa">WOGAA</a>, a web analytics tool for
    Government officers to gather usage statistics and patterns for their
    digital services easily, at no cost.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Quantifiable metrics are useful for visualisable monitoring, as it allows for
  the measurement of objective feedback regarding the teamâ€™s final delivery and
  productivity. At the same time, statistical digital analytics should not be
  the sole metric measure. A range of data sources should be used, such as the
  cost of hosting transactions, call centre data or qualitative feedback like
  user satisfaction feedbacked through interviews.

  (Objectives and Key Results) is useful for the frequent setting, tracking and
  re-evaluating of objectives and key results. This ensures all team members are
  heading in the same direction, with clear priorities, in a constant rhythm to
  achieve targeted goals. If a project falls short of achieving the goals of the
  project or is unsustainable in terms of money or time, consider retiring it.
  Learn from mistakes and if possible, reuse previous technologies for improved
  proficiency in new projects.
