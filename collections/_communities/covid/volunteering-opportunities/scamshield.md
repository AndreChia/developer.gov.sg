---

**What it is**

- System for people to report scams/spam/fake news easily by just forwarding a message/screenshot to an official reporting phone number/whatsapp endpoint. On the backend, AI/ML models are run over the incoming messages to cluster and identify them. This information can then be published as known scams, made known to the Singapore Police Force or made available to citizens directly in the form of a spam/scam filtering app.

**Why itâ€™s useful**

- There is a lot of fake news propagating during this covid crisis. This spreads very quickly and has the potential to cause panic and substantial harm if not recognized quickly. This system allows for much earlier detection and response.

**How you can help**

- Software development help with communication channels experience such as SMS/telegram/whatsapp etc.

- AI/ML help to detect phone number spoofing in calls / smses

- AI/ML help to recognize and cluster fake news types.
