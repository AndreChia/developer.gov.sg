  Singapore is embarking on a journey to build a Smart Nation, with the aim of
  harnessing technology and data to improve the lives of citizens. If you are an
  established data scientist, engineer, software developer, technologist,
  designer or applied researcher, we need your expertise and experience! Take
  three to six months to collaborate with us to co-create digital or engineering
  solutions that will make an impact on people’s lives.

<p>
  Work on projects that we have pre-identified or propose new, innovative
  projects across tech domains from artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud,
  data science, app development and cybersecurity to sensors &amp; IoT.
