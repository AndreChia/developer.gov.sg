<h2>GovTech’s Community Development Efforts</h2>
<p>
  We are excited to engage with the wider developer ecosystem as we continue to
  build and refine digital products.&nbsp; We believe that our goal - to build
  better products for the public good – can be achieved only through meaningful
  collaboration with the wider developer community.
</p>
<p>
  We see co-creation with the community as a necessity because innovation can
  happen anywhere;&nbsp;no single organisation or developer will have a monopoly
  on great ideas and inventions.
</p>
<p>You can join us in this effort through several channels:</p>
