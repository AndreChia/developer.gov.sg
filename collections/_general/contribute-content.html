<h3>
  What to write
</h3>

<p>
  Help readers of developer.gov.sg learn about tools available in the
  Government's technology ecosystem so that they can leverage them in their next
  digital project.
</p>

<p>Use the guidelines below to contribute content to developer.gov.sg:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Put the most important information first. Many readers would not bother
    scrolling down if they do not find this information at first, so make sure
    information they must know can be found as early as possible. A good place
    to start:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Features: what your product does, who the product is for</li>
    <li>
      If possible, what is the cost involved in usage of the product, and how
      much effort is needed in using it. For example, if the product requires
      specialised training to learn.
    </li>
    <li>Contact information: a form, an email etc.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>
    Be efficient with words. If possible, use pictures and videos to bring your
    point across.
  </li>
</ul>
