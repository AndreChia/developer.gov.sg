<h4>Add a new page</h4>
<p>
  You can design and add a new page under Products or Guidelines by visiting
  their pages and using the "Add new" button to bring up the web page builder.
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise, you can submit a page request by using the following form:
  <a
    href="https://go.gov.sg/contribute"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >https://go.gov.sg/contribute</a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Edit an existing page</h4>
<h5>What to write</h5>
<p>A few simple guidelines for delivering information efficiently:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Put the most important information first, e.g. the purpose of your page,
    what actions the readers can take, or the effort needed for those actions.
    Many readers would not bother scrolling down if they do not find this
    information at first, so make sure information they must know can be found
    as early as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be efficient with words. If possible, use pictures and videos to bring your
    point across.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>How to submit content</h5>
<p>To edit content on the Developer Portal, you simply need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be working in the Singapore Government</li>
  <li>
    have instant access to your Government Email inbox for a one-time
    verification code
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h5>Step 1 - Edit content directly</h5>
<p><img src="/assets/img/img_edit.png" /></p>
<p>
  Scroll to the bottom of your page and click on the "Edit This Page" button, if
  it exists. You can then start editing your content in the pop-up text editor
  window.
</p>
<h5>Step 2 - Verify Government email</h5>
<p><img src="/assets/img/img_verify.png" /></p>
<p>
  Once you are done editing, enter your Government (gov.sg) email and click on
  "Send OTP". Enter the verification code sent to your email, then click on
  "Submit Changes".
</p>
<p>
  Your proposed changes can then be tracked via GitHub
