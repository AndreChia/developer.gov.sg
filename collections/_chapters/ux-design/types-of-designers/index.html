<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The term ‘UX design’ is misleading. It refers to a broad collection of design skills and experiences that together support the development of great user experiences. But in reality, no two UX designers are exactly alike --  there are design-generalists and have built a broad base of competencies; others are design-specialists with a depth of expertise in select competency areas; some excel at craft and individual contribution, others excel at leading multi-disciplinary product teams and stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>Then there’s the matter of team size. Smaller teams, tend to look for one UX designer to cover all bases; a design-generalist who can cater to all potential UX needs.</p>
<p>Larger teams with more resources may divide their design team into more specific roles. They might distinguish between design researchers, interaction designers, content strategists and service designers. Bigger organisations may also have more variation in terms of leadership skills and domain expertise.</p>
<p>In assembling your product team, it worth spending the time to think through and articulate the specific design skills and deliverables you are looking for, and at which phase of the project lifecycle you are in (discovery, product conceptualisation, agile delivery, etc.)</p>
<p>The skills you need will change throughout the lifecycle of your service. Read more about the roles you’ll need at each service phase.</p>
<p>Your whole team, and in particular your designers, user researchers, content designers and developers, must work together to design, build and iterate a service based on the user needs of the people your service is aimed at.</p>
