<h3>Have a solution?</h3>

<p>Here are 2 problem statements we are looking for input on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >The Government is finding ways to quantify the benefits and costs to
        lessening circuit breaker measures and opening the economy. We would
        like to hear volunteer suggestions on models or optimisations (with
        parameters) that could guide policymakers in making decisions.</strong
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >How might we improve the contact tracing process to identify patterns
        in linked / unlinked cases so that we may generate the best qurantine
        yield possible in the shortest time and with the smallest manpower
        required through the use of technology and data? For the purpose of this
        problem statement, a close contact is defined as a person who has been
        in close proximity with an infected case within 2 metres and sustained
        for 30 minutes or more.</strong

<h3>Be a volunteer</h3>

<p>
  The Government has progressively built up the digital infrastructure and
  engineering capabilities as the foundation of our Smart Nation. This has
  enabled us to respond decisively and swiftly to the COVID-19 outbreak with a
  suite of digital tools to help disseminate timely and accurate information to
  Singaporeans and to enable our public agencies to better manage the crisis.

<h2>SafeEntry</h2>
<p>
  SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that is used to augment

  to aggregate people counts at different premises.&nbsp; Data will be made
  available to the public to enable them to make informed decisions on when and
  where to visit for essentials to avoid crowding and queuing, thereby reducing
  their exposure to COVID-19.
