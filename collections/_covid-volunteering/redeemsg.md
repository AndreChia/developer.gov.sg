  Simple electronic voucher/ticket creation and redemption system.
---

**What it is**

- Simple electronic voucher/ticket creation and redemption system. Given a list of recipients, creates a unique voucher link to an e-voucher and sends it to them via SMS. This voucher can be redeemed easily by a verifier (e.g. NTUC) scanning the QR code of the voucher, or by the recipient entering the verifier’s code displayed on a stall on the voucher link. All actions (voucher creation, redemption, new verifiers, etc) are tracked in real time.

**Why it’s useful**

- Digitizes paper vouchers/ tickets that are costly to print and mail out. Helps ground staff do reconciliation faster, e.g. for food vouchers, shortened time taken to pay hawkers from ~2 months to 2 weeks.

- Currently being used for food voucher distribution to low income households to help them weather the economic downturn. Also used for National Day Parade tickets and for energy efficient light voucher distribution to low income households.

- Can be used to track distribution of masks, food rations, sanitizer etc.

**How you can help**

- Community engagement volunteers needed to help train the hawkers, elderly, non-tech savvy residents how to use the voucher system.
