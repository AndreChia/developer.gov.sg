<h2>TechPass Overview</h2>
<h3>TechPass - The Engineering Suite tool</h3>
<p>
  The first product in the pipeline for Engineering Suite is TechPass that
  allows users to use ONE set of credentials for all SGTS services instead of
  separate logins for different services.
</p>
<p>
  TechPass will serve as the identity for SGTS for all developers. The
  developers from the agencies can authenticate with their Whole of Government
  (WoG) Azure AD identities to access SGTS services. The Non-government or
  vendor developers will have localised identities for access to SGTS services,
  subjected to approval.
</p>
<p>
  Onboarded Tenants (e.g.: SHIP-HATS) can easily manage access control from a
  self-service portal.
