<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The product backlog is a prioritised list of all the work a development team needs to deliver in future releases of the product. It includes features, functions, requirements, bugs, technical work and research or learning. As long as it is work that the development team needs to do to add value for the user, it should be listed in the product backlog. If an item doesn’t provide any value to the user, it’s a waste of time and effort and shouldn’t be listed on the backlog. Each backlog item should have a description, estimate and value.</p>

<h4>Product Backlog</h4>
<p>A product backlog is a living artifact and is never complete or finished. It evolves as the product and the environment change to ensure that the product is always appropriate, competitive and useful.</p>
<p>The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog and arranging the items in order of priority.</p>
<p>Usually the items at the top of the product backlog are more detailed than the ones lower on the list. The product owner will work with the development team to add detail to the backlog items during product backlog refinement. Only items for the next 2–3 sprints are defined in greater detail. Items further down the list are expected to change by the time the team gets to them, so we don’t waste time refining them until we’re ready to work on them.</p>

<h4>Minimum Viable Product</h4>
<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a strategy that entrepreneurs use to get a product which has just enough features to test an idea out into the market, with the purpose of learning quickly what works and doesn’t work, in order to guide the development of the product.</p>
<p>In our case, we employ this strategy to work out how to deliver the most business or customer value with the least amount of features. This allows us to meet the most critical needs first, so that citizens can benefit from our solution as soon as possible. After which, the learnings we get from the solution that has been launched, helps us decide what to include in future releases and where we should focus our efforts in order to provide the largest benefits.</p>

<h4>Definition of Done</h4>
<p>Each increment developed by the team needs to shippable by the end of the sprint. This means you can launch or deploy your new features or the latest version of your product any time.</p>
<p>Different organisations have different requirements for what needs to be completed before an increment is shipped. The team uses these requirements to develop the definition of ‘done’. That way everyone has the same understanding of what ‘done’ is.</p>

<h4>Test Driven Development</h4>
<p>Test Driven Development (TDD) involves quick cycles of testing, coding and refactoring.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Write an automated test case for a new function or an improvement</li>
    <li>Produce the least amount of code to pass the test</li>
    <li>Refactor the code until it is as simple and clean as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>TDD helps ensure the quality of your code because it verifies that the code you write does what you intend it to do.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong, there are only a few lines of code to check and fix. More importantly, all the tests written by the team are run with every build, so you can be sure the code continues to work as intended.</p>
<p>If someone accidentally breaks the code, the tests fail. At GovTech, when a test fails, it’s immediately highlighted on our big screens until that person manages to fix the problem.</p>
