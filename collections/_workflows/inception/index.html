<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>During this INCEPTION phase, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start building the team - Although your team will evolve over time, you will need to start identifying key team members at the start and bring them onto the team.</li>
    <li>Model the initial architecture for the system - You need to have a general idea of how you are going to build the system.</li>
    <li>Garner support and funding - At some point somebody will ask what are we going to get, how much is it going to cost, and how long is it going to take. You need to provide reasonable answers to these questions.</li>
</ul>
