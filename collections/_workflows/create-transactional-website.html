<h4>Transactional Website</h4>
<p>
  Transactional websites provide users with the ability to conduct transactions
  through the financial institution's website by initiating banking transactions
  or buying products and services.
</p>
<p>
  Transactional websites typically enable the electronic exchange of
  confidential user information and the transfer of funds, services provided
  through these websites expose a financial institution to higher risk than
  static and dynamic informational websites.
</p>
<p>
  Wholesale e-banking systems typically expose financial institutions to the
  highest risk per transaction, since commercial transactions usually involve
  larger dollar amounts. In addition to the risk issues associated with
  informational websites, examiners reviewing transactional e-banking services
  should consider the following issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Security controls for safeguarding user information</li>
  <li>
    Authentication processes necessary to initially verify the identity of new
    users and authenticate existing users who access e-banking services
  </li>
  <li>Liability for unauthorized transactions</li>
  <li>
    Losses from fraud if the institution fails to verify the identity of
    individuals or businesses applying for new accounts or credit on-line
  </li>
  <li>
    Possible violations of laws or regulations pertaining to consumer privacy,
    anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, or the content, timing, or delivery
    of required consumer disclosures
  </li>
  <li>
    Negative public perception, user dissatisfaction, and potential liability
    resulting from failure to process third-party payments as directed or within
    specified time frames, lack of availability of on-line services, or
    unauthorized access to confidential user information during transmission or
    storage
  </li>
</ul>
