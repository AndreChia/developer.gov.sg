<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>During this CONSTRUCTION AND ITERATION phase, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring quality - Be a firm believer in following guidance like coding conventions and style guidelines so as to ensure that we have the best design possible.</li>
    <li>Regularly delivering working solutions - At the end of each iteration, you should have a partial, working solution to show people. You should also be able to deploy this solution into a pre-production sandbox for system integration testing.</li>
    <li>Testing - As part of construction, we do confirmatory testing, a combination of developer testing at the design level and agile acceptance testing at the requirement level.</li>
</ul>
