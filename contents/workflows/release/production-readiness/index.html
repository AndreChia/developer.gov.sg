<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Production readiness is the practice of ensuring that your software is continuously in a state where it could be shipped at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>It’s an attitude and a mindset in which the team treats the first iteration of their software as something that could potentially be shipped, and each iteration thereafter as simply updates to a live production system.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>We can reduce a lot of risk by acting as if we had to release it every week.</p>
<br>
<h6>Faster Development</h6>
<p>Once you get into the rhythm of regularly producing working software you spend less time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fixing bugs</li>
    <li>deploying emergency patches</li>
    <li>rewriting broken features</li>
</ul>
<p>While having more time to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>improve user experience</li>
    <li>adding (or removing) new features</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Easier Project Planning</h6>
<p>Features are either done or they are not. It removes any doubt with regard to where you are with the project, and how much you have left to do.</p>
<br>
<h6>Reinforces the Good</h6>
<p>To regularly produce shippable code each week there are certain things that your team is doing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Breaking big problems into smaller and manageable ones</li>
    <li>Testing plan from the start</li>
    <li>Receiving feedback from users</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>Teams that regularly produce production-ready software usually have some combination of the following three things.</p>
<br>
<h6>Discipline</h6>
<p>It is always temping to take the easy way out. Discipline is what separates you from everyone else.</p>
<br>
<h6>Culture of Excellence</h6>
<p>Set the bar high in the beginning and keeping it there for the duration of your project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do not accept untested, poorly implemented features</li>
    <li>Do not accept people abusing the build</li>
    <li>Do not accept bugs</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Care about your Project</h6>
<p>Attract and hire people with this mindset for quality and craftmanship, because when everyone care about what they are doing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You do not need a lot of rules</li>
    <li>You do not need to write everything down</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because good people do not need to be told what to do. They take initiative and do the right thing naturally.</p>
