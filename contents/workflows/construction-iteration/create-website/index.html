                    <p>A static information website is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In simpler terms, it requires no use of the back-end.</p>
                    <p>A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator, unless there's a redesign of the site or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is stored but the actual pages of the site. There are no users, no comments, no blog posts or any interactivity. No programming languages are required to make a static site.</p>
                    <p>All public facing digital services of the Government must meet the Digital Service Standards (DSS).</p>
                    <p>The Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.</p>
                    <p>GovTech provides Isomer to support government agencies in building static information websites while complying to DSS easily.</p>

                    <p>A dynamic information website allow users to interact with it, such as commenting on a post, creating a user profile or scheduling an appointment. Examples of dynamic websites are blogs, calendar or any website that needs to be updated often.</p>
                    <p>Dynamic websites use languages like PHP to interact with information stored in databases. You will need web hosting and databases or servers. Most dynamic websites utilise a Content Management System to manage their content.</p>
                    <p>With these requirements, dynamic websites are usually more expensive to create and maintain.</p>

                    <p>A transactional website has the ability to process financial transactions. Typical transactions include online banking, financial account management, bill payment, employee payroll and application processing.</p>
