        <p>During this CONSTRUCTION AND ITERATION phase, you will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Ensuring quality -</span> Be a firm believer in following guidance like coding conventions and style guidelines so as to ensure that we have the best design possible.</li>
            <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Regularly delivering working solutions -</span> At the end of each iteration, you should have a partial, working solution to show people. You should also be able to deploy this solution into a pre-production sandbox for system integration testing.</li>
            <li><span class="has-text-weight-bold">Testing -</span> As part of construction, we do confirmatory testing, a combination of developer testing at the design level and agile acceptance testing at the requirement level.</li>
