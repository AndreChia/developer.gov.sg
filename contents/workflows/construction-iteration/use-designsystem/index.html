<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Design System was designed for the Singapore Government to unite teams in creating fast, accessible and mobile friendly digital services.</p>
<p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable, where reusability makes scale possible.</p>

<h5>Why use a Design System?</h5>
<p>This concept can be explained better with the Atomic Design, defined by Brad Frost. It is a methodology for creating design systems and there are five distinct levels in it:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Atoms:</b> The basic building blocks, for e.g. form label, an icon or a button.</li>
    <li><b>Molecules:</b> Groups of atoms bonded together to do one thing.</li>
    <li><b>Organisms:</b> Groups of molecules joined together to form a complex section of an interface.</li>
    <li><b>Templates:</b> Groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.</li>
    <li><b>Pages:</b> Pages are specific instances of templates. This is where most reviews revolve around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Atomic design provide the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can create systems that promotes consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their final context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we are crafting a system right out of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>
