<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Whether you are building a static information, <a href="">dynamic information</a> or <a href="">transactional website</a>, we have tools to support your development.</p>

<h4>Static Informational Website</h4>
<p>A static information website is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In simpler terms, it requires no use of the back-end.</p>
<p>A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator, unless there's a redesign of the site or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.</p>
<p>Nothing is stored but the actual pages of the site. There are no users, no comments, no blog posts or any interactivity. No programming languages are required to make a static site.</p>
