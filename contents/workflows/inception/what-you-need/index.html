<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>This first step is to identify the type of technologies you will need. The decisions we make must enable the team to work efficiently and allow deployed services to scale easily and cost-effectively.</p>
<p>Start by determining if the technology stack is suitable for the product/service being developed. Understand what the intended use cases are and which target platforms to support. Additionally, consider the maturity of the technology, the level of support available and how well it integrates with other technologies.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, teams should consider using open-source, commodity solutions across their technology stack, especially if these technologies have widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies.</p>
<p>Lastly, have the team weigh in on the chosen technologies and determine if there is enough expertise and experience on the team to adopt it.</p>

<h5>Flexible Hosting Environment</h5>
<p>This step is about selecting a host that has flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand.</p>
<p>Data classification and usage patterns will likely play a big part in the choice of the host. Cloud based hosting is suitable if the data is not classified and the service needs to be available publicly whereas government data centres and on-premise infrastructure are best suited for handling sensitive data or if the service needs to be available internally. Hybrid solutions can also be an option. Ideally, the chosen host should support secure remote monitoring and administration so maintenance can be carried out easily.</p>
<p>Development teams also need to consider how many deployment environments are required. For example, web services typically employ 3 distinct environments to cater for ‘development’, ’staging’ and ‘production’. It is best to keep them on the same host to reduce possible issues with compatibility.</p>

<h5>Continuous Integrations, Testings and Deployments</h5>
<p>This step is to find out how to bring testing in line with the pace of development and delivery without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>CI/T/D helps to achieve this by automating the process of creating new builds, running tests and deploying them. It reduces the reliance on manual testing and frees up the team to concentrate on other tasks. Over time, CI/T/D can also highlight problematic areas and paint an overall picture of quality and stability.</p>
<p>The chosen CI/T/D system should be capable of linking together the source control, build and testing tools employed by the team. A dashboard to display build progress and test results is also highly desirable. Lastly, the system should be configurable to target the desired deployment environment(s).</p>

    <p>SHIP is a product that provides services of a build pipeline for the whole of government. It provides managed services like Atlassian Bitbucket, Bamboo, Confluence, Jira to enable teams to build applications rapidly without having to worry about hardware costs and operations overheads of maintaining these services.</p>

<h5>Manage Security and Privacy</h5>
<p>This step is about protecting sensitive information of our digital services and keeping systems secure.</p>
<p>It is important to consider security and privacy aspects at every stage of development and deployment. At the start of designing a new service or product, the team lead should engage appropriate privacy, security and legal consultants to determine the security classification of the project, what information needs to be collected/accessed, how it is secured, how long it is kept and how it will be used and shared. Once this is determined, the appropriate security aspects needs to be designed into the overall system on both the infrastructure and software level.</p>
<p>During day-to-day-operations. the team should consider incorporating scanning tools to automate the detection of software vulnerabilities and malware as part of the CI/T/D pipeline. The team should also plan to conduct regular security checks and audits to ensure system integrity.</p>
