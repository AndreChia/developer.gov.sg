<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>The goal of the PRODUCTION phase is to keep systems useful and productive after they have been deployed to the user community. This process will differ from organization to organization and perhaps even from system to system, but the fundamental goal remains the same: keep the system running and help users to use it.</p>
