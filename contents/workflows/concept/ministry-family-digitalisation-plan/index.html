<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Ministry Family Digitalisation Plan comprises suggested approach, key principles and other reference resources that will serve as a guide to Ministry Family Chief Digital Strategy Officers (CDSOs) and relevant officers involved in developing digitalisation plans for their agencies.</p>
<p>The use of digital technologies to change a business model and provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities; it is the process of moving to a digital business</p>
<hr>
<h5>Before you start</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Examine if your organisation’s business, operating models and service delivery are still relevant and if they might be disrupted by digital technologies</li>
    <li>Determine how digitalisation can help optimise internal operations or public service transformation</li>
    <li>Aligned to business goals, set clear digital strategies to address impact on organisational design, processes, business model and personnel</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h6>Focus 1 - Citizen-centric service experience</h6>
<p>Be obsessed with your users. Understand their needs, not just based on what they say.</p>
<p>Focus on user experience, not only the user interface. The user experience should be end-to-end, covering physical and digital touch points. </p>
<br>
<h6>Focus 2 - Pro-business service experience</h6>
<p>Businesses frequently interact with the government mainly for regulations or for partnerships. By creating business-centric services and lowering the barrier to operate a business in Singapore, this will foster a more vibrant and competitive economy.</p>
<p>Government needs to review existing service models with businesses, and leverage digital technologies to create a pro-business service experience.</p>
<br>
<h6>Focus 3 - Engage Community</h6>
<p>Digital technologies open up opportunities for the community to be more connected, engaged and involved.</p>
<p>Through the use of digital platforms to connect Government and citizens, as well as citizens with fellow citizens, a “digital kampung” spirit is kindled by bringing people together to help each other.</p>
<p>This fosters a sense of belonging in the community and enables greater social cohesion.</p>
<br>
<h6>Focus 4 - Operational Excellence</h6>
<p>Operational excellence involves optimising and transforming business processes and operations. It is not only about doing more with less. It is about effectiveness, not just efficiency. It requires a review and redesign of various aspects of operations, in the face of tech disruption.</p>
<p>Don’t just automate manual processes, think about transforming processes and operations through innovative use of technology, potentially moving towards zero-ops where minimal or no human intervention is required. Find synergies across teams, organisational units, agencies and external partners.</p>
<hr>
<h6>Principle 1 - Think Simple</h6>
<p>Simplify services and streamline processes to serve citizens effectively. Organisations need to review all the processes and interfaces to identify areas that can be simplified.</p>
<p>Simplicity is not simple – it requires good judgement of what really matters, and a bold decision to focus on them. Resist the temptation and old belief of needing to be “comprehensive,” as it does not enhance user experience.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: Parking.sg</b><br>Without complex IoT sensors, URA & HDB implemented mobile app for parking within a few months.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 2 - Be agile and iterate</h6>
<p>With rising expectations for faster delivery and increasing number of digital natives in our population, Government needs to be agile and highly adaptive. Take an outside-in, iterative approach in developing services, starting first with a minimum viable product (MVP), and improve progressively with feedback to get to the final implementation. New features will be prioritised and progressively added in each iteration.</p>
<p>Being agile will require user executives to be fully involved in the design and development process along with tech developers.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: MOM FDW</b><br>MOM implemented Foreign Domestic Worker’s work pass system with multiple releases over 12 months, with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 9 months.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 3 - Co-develop and co-deliver with Citizens</h6>
<p>Government does not always have the best answers to all the issues. Involve stakeholders to co-create the solutions. Beyond ideation at Hackathons, digital technologies such as open data APIs make it easier for citizens to build applications that could benefit them, as well as help solve some of the problems Government faces.</p>
<p>Digital platforms have also made it possible to mobilise citizens to co-deliver services to the community they belong. Co-developing and co-delivering with citizens catalyse innovation beyond Government and empower citizens in new ways.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: SCDF MyResponder</b><br>SCDF crowdsource citizens as 1st responder for cardiac arrest emergencies via myResponder.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Case study: Data.gov.sg</b><br>Public can access Government data and APIs from Data.gov.sg to develop innovative apps.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 4 - Partner external organisations</h6>
<p>Partner external organisations to tap into capabilities, resources and talent beyond the public sector. Such collaborations will enable development of new products and services, and enhancements of existing ones.</p>
<p>Digital platforms are needed for connection to external organisations. Government can own such digital platforms or connect to platforms operated by other organisations.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: National Trade Platform</b><br>Through the National Trade Platform, Government partners the private sector to develop and offer services to the trade and logistics community</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 5 - Collect, share and use data</h6>
<p>Collect useful data to ask the correct questions and make better-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Analyse and use the data insights to make better, “smarter” and quicker decisions to drive policy, planning, service delivery and operational excellence.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: LTA PLANET</b>PLANET enables LTA planners to tap on public transport data for planning and policy making.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 6 - Use government tech stack to expedite delivery</h6>
<p>Accelerate product delivery by leveraging government tech stack for common services, platforms and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The government tech stack comprises common tech building blocks that let you integrate easily, reuse many times and build applications securely.</p>
<p>Similarly, reuse WOG standard products and solutions without having to re-invent the wheel.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: Business Grants Portal</b><br>Business Grants Portal leveraged Government Tech Stack to shorten delivery time.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 7 - Foster a digital DNA</h6>
<p>Digital transformation requires a mindset and cultural change within the organisation, emphasising values such as agility, boldness, innovation and collaboration.</p>
<p>Top leadership plays an important role in driving and sustaining this cultural change, fostering the values amongst all the people in the organisation, and embedding them into every aspect of work.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: DBS</b><br>DBS inculcates and nurtures a digital and innovative mindset among all its staff.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 8 - Integrate Ops and Tech</h6>
<p>Tighter integration between Operations and Technology is essential for digital transformation. An agency’s Ops can include frontline / backend operations and business processes. Ops-Tech integration needs to begin from the early stages of planning and conceptualisation. Digital initiatives should be jointly managed, executed and owned by both Ops and Tech teams.</p>
<p>Ops-Tech integration can enable new business models by bringing together operational considerations and new technological possibilities.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case studies: NEA IFOS & MOM iOSH</b><br>The Integrated Field Operations System has helped NEA to seamlessly integrate operational workflows, sensor systems and analytics. Mobile iOSH empowers safety inspectors to perform effective enforcement anytime, anywhere.</blockquote>
<br>
<h6>Principle 9 - Manage change and drive adoption</h6>
<p>With new digital products and services, Government cannot assume that mere implementation will ensure public adoption. To help citizens and businesses embrace the new products / services, there should be public communications and campaigns to raise awareness, and demonstration of clear benefits of these new products / services.</p>
<p>Work within the organisation should also be adjusted to support the new ways of delivering the digital products and services.</p>
<blockquote><b>Case study: IRAS e-Filing</b><br>IRAS drives successful implementation of multiple generations of e-Filing transformation amongst taxpayers.</blockquote>
