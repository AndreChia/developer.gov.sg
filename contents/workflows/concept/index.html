<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>During this Concept phase, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Define the Business Opportunity - You must consider the bigger picture and focus on market concerns. This includes exploring how the new functionality will improve your organisation's presence in the market, and the impact it is trying to create.</li>
    <li>Identify a Viable for the Project - There are several issues to consider when identifying a potential strategy for the project. For example, do you build a new system or buy an existing package and modify it?</li>
    <li>Assess the Feasibility - You will want to do just enough feasibility analysis to determine if it makes sense to invest in the potential project.</li>
</ul>
