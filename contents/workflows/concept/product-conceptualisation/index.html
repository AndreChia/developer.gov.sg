<h5>The close integration of Design, Product and Engineering is critical for agile projects to succeed:</h5>
<p>Design is not just an upfront phase of work, but there needs to the commitment to resource design as a continuous workstream throughout the entire project lifecycle.</p>
<p>The collaboration model should be that Design, Product & Engineering work as equals versus one reporting into the other.</p>
<p>The project owner/product owner is committed to user centred practices and continuous iteration based on user research, prototyping, testing with real users.</p>
<p>There are three key phases of design throughout the digital project lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery</li>
    <li>Product Conceptualisation</li>
    <li>UX Design</li>
</ul>

<h4>Discovery</h4>
<h6>What is the Discovery Phase about?</h6>
<p>The purpose of discovery is to identify and understand the problem that needs to be solved, before committing to building a digital product or service. This means learning about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Potential users and what they are trying to achieve</li>
    <li>Any operations or technical constraints (e.g. existing processes, systems, legacy technology)</li>
    <li>The underlying policy intent that the government wants to implement</li>
    <li>Opportunities areas to create improvement or enable change</li>
</ul>
<p>What we learn through discovery will guide whether to move forward to product conceptualisation. It should not be an exercise to simply validate customer hypotheses or requirements.</p>
<p>Example activities during discovery include user research, mapping and prioritising pain points, framing problem statements and opportunities, testing hypotheses, exploring alternatives to building a new digital product or service that could solve the problem more effectively.</p>
<p>It is not a failure if the project does not proceed to product conceptualisation - if the research shows that the problem is better addressed via alternative solutions.</p>
<br>
<h6>How long should a Discovery Phase take?</h6>
<p>There’s no set time period for discovery, but around 8 to 12 weeks is typical. Let the purpose of your discovery dictate how long the team spends on it.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a problem that no one has researched before, you might need a bit longer. If it’s a problem and group of users that you know a fair bit about already, you might be able to get away with a slightly shorter discovery.</p>
<br>
<h6>Deciding whether to move forward to Product Conceptualisation</h6>
<p>Do not proceed to product conceptualisation if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is no compelling problem, opportunity or user need</li>
    <li>There is no compelling argument for the Government to provide the digital product or service</li>
    <li>User needs are already being well met by existing solutions</li>
    <li>Tech or policy constraints mean solution cannot be delivered anytime soon</li>
    <li>Partner stakeholders are not ready for user-centred practices</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do decide to move on to product conceptualisation, you’ll need to make sure you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the wider context and overall service journey, and the other teams and organisations that could be working to address similar and related problems</li>
    <li>Are clear on how what you’re working on fits into that wider problem space and service journey</li>
    <li>Have a list of possible concepts that you’d like to test during product conceptualisation and an idea of which one you’d like to prototype first (and why)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Product Conceptualisation</h4>
<h6>What is the Product Conceptualisation Phase all about?</h6>
<p>The purpose of product conceptualisation is to try out different possible solutions to the problems that have been prioritised during discovery, before committing to the agile development of a digital product or service. This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Challenging the ways things are done and exploring new approaches</li>
    <li>Creating prototypes to experiment with different possible solutions</li>
    <li>Testing the riskiest assumptions</li>
    <li>Building to the fidelity necessary to learn, not production ready code</li>
</ul>
<p>What we learn through product conceptualisation will guide which of the possible solutions are worth taking into agile development. It should not be an exercise to simply gather requirements and translate into a product backlog.</p>
<p>Example activities during product conceptualisation include, looking at how a possible solution would affect the wider service journey, gaining an understanding of what would need to happen to make the journey as a whole work as well as possible, exploring how possible solutions can both meet user needs and work within identified constraints, defining the product vision and roadmap, gathering sufficient evidence to help inform the budget, resourcing and time estimates to deliver an MVP.</p>
<p>It is not a failure if the project does not proceed to agile development - if the research shows that existing / off the shelf digital solutions can adequately meet users’ needs and are more cost effective.</p>
<br>
<h6>Deciding whether to move on to agile development of an MVP</h6>
<p>There’s no set time period for conceptualisation, but around 3 to 4 months is typical. Let the complexity of your problem space and potential solutions dictate how long the team spends on it.</p>
<p>Product conceptualisation is finished when you’ve got a prototype that’s substantial enough to help you make a decision about whether to invest in the agile development of an MVP or not.</p>
<p>If you get to the end of your timeline and you’re not confident, you could pause or decide to repeat discovery or conceptualisation as appropriate.</p>
<p>Do not proceed if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are better commercial / industry solutions</li>
    <li>The potential impact does not justify the potential effort and cost</li>
    <li>Partner stakeholders are not able to run agile, user-centred practices</li>
    <li>Full-scale implementation is not viable from a policy, ops or service perspective</li>
    <li>Dependent agencies are not able to support the operationalization of the solution</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re confident you want to move on to beta, partner with your product, tech and business leads (and agency stakeholders) to work on a funding proposal.</p>

<h4>UX Design</h4>
<p>The purpose of user experience design is to take responsibility for all aspects of the end-users’ interaction with a government service and its associated digital experiences. It starts with the gathering of user insights, its translation into the design and implementation of user interactions, content, interfaces and processes, but can stretch to reimagining entire service journeys to make them simpler, more human-centred and more impactful. This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designing how people will interact with a digital product or service, and how to elicit the desired user behaviours and outcomes</li>
    <li>Defining how information should be structured, the relationships between different types of content and making it easy to navigate</li>
    <li>Defining how the presentation layers of a product or service look, to elevate the user experience, usability and engagement</li>
    <li>Running usability testing to identify friction, inform design iteration and qualify improvements</li>
    <li>Making sure everyone can use the digital service by testing for accessibility and addressing usability challenges that might lead to people being unintentionally excluded</li>
</ul>
<p>It is about supporting the agile development of the digital product or service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements informed by user research, testing and product data. It should not be an exercise to simply deliver on user stories.</p>
<p>Example activities include close collaboration with product owners, product managers, software engineers, quality engineers, etc., delivery of low-fidelity to high-fidelity design assets as appropriate throughout the agile sprint cycle and balancing the short term need to deliver on the product backlog with the need to look ahead at how user needs are changing and how the user experience needs to evolve to meet those changing needs.</p>
