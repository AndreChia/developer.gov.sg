<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>In this section, you will understand Agile Software Development Life Cycle, putting it in context from what you may have heard about within the agile community and more importantly within the context of our efforts on the delivery of transformative digital projects in Singapore Government.</p>
<h5>Agile Process Flow</h5>
<p>The agile software development lifecycle is dominated by the iterative process. Each iteration results in the next piece of the software development puzzle - working software and supporting elements, such as documentation, available for use by customers - until the final product is complete.</p>

<p>Each iteration is usually two to four weeks in length and has a fixed completion time. Due to its time-bound nature, the iteration process is methodical and the scope of each iteration is only as broad as the allotted time allows.</p>
<p>Multiple iterations will take place during the agile software development lifecycle and each follows its own workflow. During an iteration, it is important that the customers and business stakeholders provide feedback to ensure that the features meet their needs.</p>
<p>A typical iteration process flow can be visualized as follows. Within each process, you can see the government products and guidelines available to support it.</p>
