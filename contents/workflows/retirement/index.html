<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>During this RETIREMENT phase, you will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No longer support the release - Sometimes organizations will have several releases in production at the same time, and over time older releases are dropped.</li>
    <li>Replace the current system - It is not uncommon to see homegrown systems being replaced by COTS systems.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Manage the Changes</h5>

                <p>Releasing a new product is not the end of the story. Donâ€™t diminish the importance of helping your users with adapting to the changes.</p>
