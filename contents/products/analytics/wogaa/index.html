        <p>
            With more people interacting with the Government through websites
            and mobile applications, it is important for us to understand how
            our digital services are performing and continually enhance user
            experience. There are many analytical tools in the market that can
            be used to track digital consumption such as tools from market
            leaders Google (Google Analytics) and Adobe (Adobe Analytics) but
            these tools require manpower to implement and maintain and may incur
            substantial costs.
        </p>

            Today we will be introducing WOGAA, our solution in providing
            digital analytics at scale for government digital services.
