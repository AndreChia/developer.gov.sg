<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>With more people interacting with the Government through websites and mobile applications, it is important for us to
    understand how our digital services are performing and continually enhance user experience. There are many
    analytical tools in the market that can be used to track digital consumption such as tools from market leaders
    Google (Google Analytics) and Adobe (Adobe Analytics) but these tools require manpower to implement and maintain and
    may incur substantial costs.</p>
<p>Today we will be introducing WOGAA, our solution in providing digital analytics at scale for government digital
    services.</p>
<h5>Features</h5>
<p>Metrics and Measurements: WOGAA provide a set of common metrics and measurements to enable public agencies to conduct
    real-time monitoring of the performance of their websites and digital services, conveniently and cost-effectively.
</p>
<p>Central Dashboard: WOGAA presents the overall health status of government websites and digital services and an
    analytics tool that can be embedded within agencies' websites and digital services for personal tracking. No
    personal data will be tracked in the monitoring process.</p>
