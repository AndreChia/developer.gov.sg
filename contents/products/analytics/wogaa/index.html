          <p>With more people interacting with the Government through websites and mobile applications, it is important for us to understand how our digital services are performing and continually enhance user experience. There are many analytical tools in the market that can be used to track digital consumption such as tools from market leaders Google (Google Analytics) and Adobe (Adobe Analytics) but these tools require manpower to implement and maintain and may incur substantial costs.</p>
          <p>Today we will be introducing WOGAA, our solution in providing digital analytics at scale for government digital services.</p>
