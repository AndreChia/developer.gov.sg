    <div class="col">
        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Auditory</h3>
        <p>Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears ("hard of hearing"), to substantial and uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears ("deafness").</p>
        <p>Some people can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This includes people using hearing aids or other approaches to improve the sound.</p>
        <p>Some of the barriers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without captions or transcripts</li>
            <li>Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide volume controls</li>
            <li>Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions</li>
            <li>Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only</li>
            <li>Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text that is difficult to read</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Cognitive and Neurological</h3>
        <p>Cognitive and neurological disabilities involve disorders of any part of the nervous system, including the brain and the peripheral nervous system. This can impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information.</p>
        <p>Examples: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down syndrome, Multiple sclerosis, Dyslexia.</p>
        <p>Some of the barriers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use</li>
            <li>Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand</li>
            <li>Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context</li>
            <li>Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off</li>
            <li>Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio</li>
            <li>Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets</li>
        </ul>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Physical</h3>
        <p>Physical disabilities (sometimes called "motor disabilities") include weakness, limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint problems (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, or missing limbs.</p>
        <p>Some of the barriers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support</li>
            <li>Insufficient time limits to respond or to complete tasks, such as to fill out online forms</li>
            <li>Controls, including links with images of text, that do not have equivalent text alternatives</li>
            <li>Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids</li>
            <li>Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complex navigation mechanisms and page functions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Speech</h3>
        <p>Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software.</p>
        <p>For instance, the loudness or clarity of someone's voice might be difficult to understand.</p>
        <p>Some of the barriers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only</li>
            <li>Websites offering phone numbers as the only way to communicate with the organization</li>
        </ul>

<hr class="margin--bottom--lg margin--top--lg">

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Visual</h3>
        <p>Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision impairments in one or both eyes ("low vision" or "partial sight"), to substantial and uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes ("blindness").</p>
        <p>Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors ("color blindness"), or increased sensitivity towards excessive brightness in colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity.</p>
        <p>Some of the barriers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives</li>
            <li>Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized</li>
            <li>Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids</li>
            <li>Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track</li>
            <li>Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complex navigation mechanisms and page functions</li>
            <li>Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations</li>
            <li>Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support use of custom color combinations</li>
        </ul>
