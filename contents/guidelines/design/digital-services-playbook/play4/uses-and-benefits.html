        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Supports Social Inclusion</h3>
        <p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right. Web accessibility provides equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities, helping them to participate in society more actively.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Eldery Users with Age-Related Impairments</h3>
        <p>Elderly users with deteriorating vision and hearing find it easier to use websites which have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More contrast between background and foreground colors</li>
            <li>Text that can be enlarged</li>
            <li>Elements which do not flash or blink quickly which can cause seizures</li>
            <li>Using keyboard rather than mouse due to poor motor control</li>
            <li>Support for screen readers</li>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Increases Usability</h3>
        <p>Web accessibility would increase convenience of users with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear and simple language</li>
            <li>Supplemental illustrations</li>
            <li>Clear and consistent design, navigation, and links</li>
            <li>Blocks of information divided into groups</li>
            <li>Text that does not blink, flash or move too much</li>
            <li>Provide users enough time to read and use content</li>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Low Bandwidth Connections and Older Technologies</h3>
        <p>Low bandwidth can be due to location, for example, rural areas where high speed connections are not available or mobile phone reception is limited, bandwidth congestion and connection technology. Some older technologies load pages very slowly and do not support features used on newer sites. Such people benefit from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text alternatives for images, multimedia and other non-text objects for people whose older technology cannot access multimedia formats or connections are too slow to download multimedia files</li>
            <li>Text size defined as relative units for older browsers that do not override absolute text sizes</li>
            <li>Styled text instead of bitmap images of text to convey information increases download speed</li>
            <li>Style sheets used effectively to separate content from presentation decreases file size and file download requirements thus increasing download speed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Expands Potential Market Share and Positive Image</h3>
        <p>Though estimates vary, most studies find that about one fifth of the population has some form of disability that can affect their capacity to use the Internet with ease.</p>
        <p>Businesses would be unwise to purposely exclude 20, 10, or even 5 percent of their potential customers from their web sites. For schools, universities, and government entities it would not only be unwise, but in many cases, would also violate the law.</p>
        <p>Moreover, people with disabilities and older people are particularly likely to be loyal customers of websites that work well for them. Word-of-mouth or "viral marketing" can be significant among these groups.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Increases Findability with Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alternative text for images and multimedia is available to search engines</li>
            <li>Most search engines access text and not images</li>
            <li>Some search engines give higher weight to text that is marked up as headings</li>
            <li>Some search engines are unable to access some script-generated content such as mouse-overs</li>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Decreases Costs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decreases personnel costs for maintaining the site: Accessibility reduces site maintenance</li>
            <li>Decreases the amount of server capacity needed and saves on additional server costs: Accessibility reduces server load</li>
            <li>Decreases the need for creating multiple versions of a site for different devices: Accessibility enables content to work on different devices</li>
