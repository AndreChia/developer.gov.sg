        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">When Initiating a Project, The Question Matters Most</h3>
        <p>Having available data and knowledge of analytics methods no doubt figure prominently in any analytics project. But the most important factor of success lies in the brief: breaking down broad questions into well-framed problem statements that guide the effort.</p>
        <p>Use this Scoping Worksheet to define your problem statement and determine the potential value of analytics to your work, before you decide on whether to embark on an analytics project or not.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Step 1 - Defining the problem</h5>
        <p>This first step is about taking stock of the problem and why it’s worth solving before settling on data analytics to support downstream solutions and strategies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
            <li>How do you know the problem exists?</li>
            <li>What is wrong with the current situation and why can’t it continue the way it is?</li>
            <li>What would an improvement look like?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Step 2 - Mapping the Process</h5>
        <p>This step provides a clear perspective of where the insights provided by data analytics can offer value, at what points, to whom, or how the system might support or adopt data-driven solutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk us through the process for formulating your policies, running operations</li>
            <li>What additional information can help improve how you formulate policies /run / operations / deliver a quality product</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Step 3 - Assessing your Data</h5>
        <p>This step is about understanding your current measures and the availability of your datasets.</p>
        <p>Understanding measurable indicators gives us insight into how you are currently assessing performance and how the current state is incentivized to behave.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What KPIs or measures do you use to quantify the problem currently? Why do you use these KPIs or measures? Be specific</li>
            <li>What other KPIs or measures could be relevant to quantify the problem? What are these relevant? Be specific</li>
            <li>What contributing factors are relevant to your problem? Why?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding the availability and quality of your datasets gives insight into how able the team will be to undertake analytics, how useful it is and how much effort will be required to prepare the data before it can be processed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What data do you collect that are relevant to your problem? What data do you collect that may be relevant to contribuing factors to the problem?</li>
            <li>How are the data collected? What formats are they stored in?</li>
            <li>Are the data all from the same databases? If not, what is the linking variable for combining the datasets</li>
            <li>Are the data collected in the same way? Are the same data variables collected over time? If the different variables are collected, is there a mapping to merge them?</li>
            <li>What is the time period that the data covers? How large is the data? How many observations?</li>
            <li>Are you aware of any limitations to the data as it pertains to this project?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Step 4 - Reframing the Problem for Analytics</h5>
        <p>This step is about building your analytics hypothesis, starting with defining your key measurable outcome.</p>
        <p>First, an example</p>
        <p>Say you want to increase the welfare of a country, your desired outcome might be to increase economic output or happiness. Your key measurable outcome in this case would be GDP per capita, or in the case of happiness, it could be, say, the percentage of people in the city square (your target sample of the population) who are smiling. You’d need a hypothesis of what the contributing factors are, in order to measure your ability to influence your way to the desired outcome. Your hypothesis might be that the contributing factor of hot weather reduces the level of happiness, which is quantifiable as a reduction in the percentage of people in the city square who are smiling. To influence the outcome, you might undertake interventions such as installing fans to lower the temperature (the contributing factor in your hypothesis) and therefore increase the percentage of people in the city square who are smiling -- your key measurable outcome.</p>
        <p>Let’s now pinpoint your key outcomes, variables of interest to frame the problem for analytics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are the key measurable outcomes you wish to influence?</li>
            <li>What are some measurable contributing factors that could influence the outcomes?</li>
            <li>What are your hypotheses on how these factors influence the outcomes?</li>
            <li>What interventions could you undertake to influence the outcomes?</li>
            <li>Who is the group that you ultimately wish to influence?</li>
            <li>Who is representative of this group? Why did you choose this sample? Is this sample representative of your population of interest?</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Step 5 - Identifying the Actionable Impact from Analytics</h5>
        <p>To set up the project for success, you need a clear, quantifiable benefit, explicit buy-in from key management stakeholders to authorize the release of data and implement the policy or operational outcomes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What does a data-driven solution bring to the table?</li>
            <li>How would you quantify the expected gains (eg. KPIs, costs, manpower savings)? How will the team know the effort and time are worth it? Are the gains sustainable?</li>
            <li>Who are the key stakeholders?</li>
            <li>Why does the problem matter to them?</li>
            <li>How onboard are they?</li>
            <li>How invested is the organization in developing internal data analytics capabilities?</li>
            <li>Is there buy-in from people who can implement policy or operational changes? Who?</li>
            <li>Is there buy-in from people who can authorize the release of data from IT departments? Who?</li>
            <li>Is the analytics solution for a one-off or a recurring problem?</li>
            <li>Assuming the analytics prove fantastic, how will that change the way you go about policy or operations as a result of what the analytics suggest? How do you intend to scale the findings from the analytics project?</li>
            <li>How invested is the organization in developing internal data analytics capabilities?</li>
            <li>What are your timelines and milestones for the analytics?</li>
            <li>What are your timelines and milestones for downstream implementation?</li>
        </ul>
