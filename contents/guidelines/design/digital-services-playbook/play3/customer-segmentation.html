        <p>Customer segmentation refers to the division of your target group into sub-groups based on some similar characteristics that they share (e.g. demographics, place of residence, employment, income level, etc.).</p>
        <p>The choice of characteristics is dependent on your question of interest as well as data availability.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">What’s the Purpose of Customer Segmentation?</h5>
        <p>Customer segmentation helps you understand your target group better, which in turn informs your operational choices, such as:</p>
        <p>Public Policy: Who will be affected by this policy? Which outreach channels would reach them most effectively? Are there group-specific implications that I should address first?</p>
        <p>Political Campaign: Who are the voters I want to court? Which issues do they care about? What type of argument appeals to them?</p>
        <p>Manufacturing: Who buys my product? What type of advertising message would entice them to buy more? Are there niche groups that I can target?</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Should I Perform Customer Segmentation?</h5>
        <p>Consider customer segmentation if you meet both criteria below:</p>
        <p>You have a scenario (e.g. policy review, program launch) where understanding your target group would help you shape your decisions.</p>
        <p>If the end product is a report for your senior management with no concrete follow-up, there is no need to go through this.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Appropriate Data</h5>
        <p>You have rich, granular, and relevant information on your target group.</p>
        <p>Rich: The more variables you have, the richer your dataset, and the better for your analysis.</p>
        <p>Granular: Avoid aggregation wherever possible. For example, if you are looking at a policy that affects students, having individual students’ exam scores would enable you to have a much richer analysis than having average exam scores for each school.</p>
        <p>Relevant: Make sure you have information that’s relevant for your scenario. For example, if you are interested in how Singaporeans feel about foreigners, ensure that your dataset actually includes some measure of their attitude towards foreigners.</p>
