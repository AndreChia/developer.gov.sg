        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold">User research focuses on human behaviour, needs and motivations. Why is someone performing a task in a particular way? What are the emotions he or she goes through when doing it? These are important questions to answer if you want to create something truly useful.</h5>

        <p>Research methods are aplenty but they can be divided into quantitative and qualitative methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Surveys, Data analytics</li>
            <li>Interviews, observation, user journey mapping, focus group discussion, surveys, ideation workshops</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">User Journey / Experience Maps</h3>
        <p>Draw up consumer journey maps and experience maps. It is easier to iterate and innovate with a baseline. Not just for your own organisation, but for the other organisations in the same domain. It is even easier to iterate and innovate when you compare experience maps, because thatâ€™s when you spot more gaps that you are able to plug.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Contextual Enquiry / Ethnography Studies</h3>
        <p>Validate your assumptions by talking to real users. Conduct contextual inquiries and ethnography studies to observe how people really do things in realistic environments. The findings you get here will be the foundation for the next step (design & prototyping).</p>

        <p>Besides observing how people work, it is also important to listen to them speak about their experience.</p>
        <p>Quantify findings into user needs. One way is to write descriptive tasks that users perform.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Make a table booking at a restaurant at peak hour, on their phone while on the move</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Notice how this defines your problem space really well: expectation of table availability; traffic congestion; small screen size; time-stress environment; spotty network connections in the subway.</p>
