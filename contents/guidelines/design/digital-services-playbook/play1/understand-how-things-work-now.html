        <p>UX is not something new. It’s a shift in mindset that places people at the centre of the design process.</p>

            <p><q>User Experience is an experience that encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.</q> - Nielsen Norman Group</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This means that designing a positive experience requires looking further beyond what you are designing for. Your service may just be one step of a user’s multi-step workflow involving other tools or services.</p>
        <p>A UX practitioner aims to understand how people use a product or service and what their motivations are, so he or she can develop better solutions. People enjoy a positive experience when it is easy and quick for them to fulfill their needs.</p>
        <p>A good place to start is to study how people use your product or service and reduce the amount of work they need to do.</p>
        <p>Simply put, UX is about designing something that’s both useful and usable. To get there, you need to research, build and test over and over again.</p>

        <p>It is unlikely that your new solution will be born in a vacuum. Map out the various existing digital touchpoints your business has with your users, and consider how your potential solution can fit into the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>You may also discover existing resources that you can leverage and extend or improve on.</p>
