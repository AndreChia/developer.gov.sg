        <p>This stage is characterised by quick prototyping, using cheap and fast methods to intentionally leave out the details to focus on the bigger picture (such as overall flow). Use paper prototyping and mix with other techniques like participatory sketching to achieve better results.</p>
        <p>Test early! You can test with people even with scribbles on pieces of paper. (Guerilla testing) In fact, people are more willing to suggest risky changes when they notice that the design is still in its infancy.</p>
