        <p>You can try following these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recruit at least 5 subjects for each version of your prototype.</li>
            <li>Introduce yourself and explain you are looking for problems in a new product, that if they have trouble, it’s the product’s fault, not theirs, that they shouldn’t feel bad.</li>
            <li>Let them know it’s OK to quit at any time.</li>
            <li>Go over the equipment - computers, camera, etc</li>
            <li>Explain how to <q>think aloud</q>... and let them know you will not provide any help.</li>
            <li>Describe the tasks and introduce the product.</li>
            <li>Ask if there are any questions, then begin the test.</li>
            <li>Conclude the test by thanking your subjects and asking for questions.</li>
            <li>Apply the results and test again.</li>
        </ul>
