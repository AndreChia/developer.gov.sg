        <p>Collecting data to inform and improve usability is consistently a challenge, for any organisations. When it comes to quantitative versus qualitative research, best practices suggest a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches to effectively capture a more holistic perspective.</p>
        <p>The difference between quantitative and qualitative approaches is often explained using contrasting terminology like hard v soft, numeric vs non-numeric, statistics vs insights, measure vs explore, what vs why.</p>
        <p>These quick contrasts are useful to highlight both the strengths and limitations of each approach if used solely without consideration of the other.</p>

        <p>Quantitative gives context where the collected feedback allows you to understand your siteâ€™s usability in the context of a much bigger picture.</p>
        <p>You can try following these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draft a screening criteria document before you begin designing your tests. The kind of users you recruit will affect the kind of results you will achieve. Usually, it is ideal to test with real users of an existing product or service if you are doing a redesign.</li>
            <li>Define quantifiable metrics (refer back to Step 2.1) such as <q>number of successful checkouts</q> or <q>time taken to complete a transaction</q>.</li>
            <li>Decide a Confidence Interval you are comfortable with and run remote tests with your clickable prototype.</li>
            <li>Test with real users of the product / service.</li>
            <li>If in production, continue monitoring with Data Analytics tools.</li>
        </ul>
