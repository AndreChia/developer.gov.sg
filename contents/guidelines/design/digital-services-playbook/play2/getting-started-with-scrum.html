        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">Agile Software Development</h3>
        <p>Agile is an approach to software development that helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cycles.</p>
        <p>Agile recognises that developing software sequentially, similar to a production line, or using a ‘waterfall’ approach, doesn’t produce the best results. In the time taken to develop the software, business realities have changed and the product has become irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Instead, Agile advocates all phases – architecture, design, development, testing and deployment – be done at the same time by a cross-functional team of specialists. This ensures that the different specialists communicate better and that each delivery is a small shippable piece of software.</p>
        <p>At the start and end of each work cycle, or sprint, the Product Owner can assess the direction of the project and adapt to changing conditions, choosing to build what provides the most value at the time.</p>
        <p>The Development Team conducts daily standups throughout the sprint to update progresses and identify blockers so as to meet the initial commitments set at the start of sprint.</p>
        <p>With each increment shipped at the end of a sprint, you get value out of completed features immediately.</p>

        <h3 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--bottom">What is Scrum?</h3>
        <p>Agile is more of a mindset based on the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. Scrum is an Agile framework that provides a guide to implementing an Agile way of working in an organisation. At GovTech, we use Scrum to help our cross-functional teams work together effectively.</p>
        <p>Scrum is based on empiricism, which states that you should make decisions based on what you know and what you know comes from experience. That’s why our approach is iterative and incremental. So that we can make decisions based on results, rather than speculate or guess. For Scrum to work, there must be transparency, inspection and adaptation.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Transparency</h5>
        <p>Transparency means the process should be visible to everyone who is responsible for the outcome and there should be a common standard and understanding of how things work. Making sure the people delivering the work have the same Definition of Done as the people accepting the work, is one way to ensure transparency.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Inspection</h5>
        <p>Scrum encourages the team to frequently reflect on the quality of their work, progress towards the sprint goal, processes and ways of working, to make sure they are on track and working in the best way possible. The Sprint Retrospective is one of the avenues for regular reflection.</p>
        <h5 class="has-text-weight-semibold margin--top--lg margin--bottom">Adaptation</h5>
        <p>Inspecting and adapting go hand-in-hand. When the team realises that something isn’t working well, they need to adjust and improve. There should be a list of action items after the Sprint Retrospective that helps the team adapt.</p>
