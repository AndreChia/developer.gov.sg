        <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) involves quick cycles of testing, coding and refactoring.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write an automated test case for a new function or an improvement</li>
            <li>Produce the least amount of code to pass the test</li>
            <li>Refactor the code until it is as simple and clean as possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TDD helps ensure the quality of your code because it verifies that the code you write does what you intend it to do.</p>
        <p>If something goes wrong, there are only a few lines of code to check and fix. More importantly, all the tests written by the team are run with every build, so you can be sure the code continues to work as intended.</p>
        <p>If someone accidentally breaks the code, the tests fail. At GDS, when a test fails, itâ€™s immediately highlighted on our big screens until that person manages to fix the problem.</p>
