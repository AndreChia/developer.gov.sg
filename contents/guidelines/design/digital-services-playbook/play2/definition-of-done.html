        <p>Each increment developed by the team needs to shippable by the end of the sprint. This means you can launch or deploy your new features or the latest version of your product any time.</p>
        <p>Different organisations have different requirements for what needs to be completed before an increment is shipped. The team uses these requirements to develop the definition of ‘done’. That way everyone has the same understanding of what ‘done’ is.</p>
