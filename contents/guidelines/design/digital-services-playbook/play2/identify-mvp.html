        <p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a strategy that entrepreneurs use to get a product which has just enough features to test an idea out into the market, with the purpose of learning quickly what works and doesnâ€™t work, in order to guide the development of the product.</p>
        <p>In our case, we employ this strategy to work out how to deliver the most business or customer value with the least amount of features. This allows us to meet the most critical needs first, so that citizens can benefit from our solution as soon as possible. After which, the learnings we get from the solution that has been launched, helps us decide what to include in future releases and where we should focus our efforts in order to provide the largest benefits.</p>
