        <p>This step is about protecting sensitive information of our digital services and keeping systems secure.</p>
        <p>It is important to consider security and privacy aspects at every stage of development and deployment. At the start of designing a new service or product, the team lead should engage appropriate privacy, security and legal consultants to determine the security classification of the project, what information needs to be collected/accessed, how it is secured, how long it is kept and how it will be used and shared. Once this is determined, the appropriate security aspects needs to be designed into the overall system on both the infrastructure and software level.</p>
        <p>During day-to-day-operations. the team should consider incorporating scanning tools to automate the detection of software vulnerabilities and malware as part of the CI/T/D pipeline. The team should also plan to conduct regular security checks and audits to ensure system integrity.</p>
