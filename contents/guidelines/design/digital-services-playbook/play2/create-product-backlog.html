        <p>The product backlog is a prioritised list of all the work a development team needs to deliver in future releases of the product. It includes features, functions, requirements, bugs, technical work and research or learning. As long as it is work that the development team needs to do to add value for the user, it should be listed in the product backlog. If an item doesn’t provide any value to the user, it’s a waste of time and effort and shouldn’t be listed on the backlog. Each backlog item should have a description, estimate and value.</p>
        <p>A product backlog is a living artifact and is never complete or finished. It evolves as the product and the environment change to ensure that the product is always appropriate, competitive and useful.</p>
        <p>The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog and arranging the items in order of priority.</p>
        <p>Usually the items at the top of the product backlog are more detailed than the ones lower on the list. The product owner will work with the development team to add detail to the backlog items during product backlog refinement. Only items for the next 2–3 sprints are defined in greater detail. Items further down the list are expected to change by the time the team gets to them, so we don’t waste time refining them until we’re ready to work on them.</p>
