        <p>This first step is to identify the type of technologies you will need. The decisions we make must enable the team to work efficiently and allow deployed services to scale easily and cost-effectively.</p>
        <p>Start by determining if the technology stack is suitable for the product/service being developed. Understand what the intended use cases are and which target platforms to support. Additionally, consider the maturity of the technology, the level of support available and how well it integrates with other technologies.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, teams should consider using open-source, commodity solutions across their technology stack, especially if these technologies have widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies.</p>
        <p>Lastly, have the team weigh in on the chosen technologies and determine if there is enough expertise and experience on the team to adopt it.</p>
