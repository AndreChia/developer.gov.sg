        <p>This step is about selecting a host that has flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand.</p>
        <p>Data classification and usage patterns will likely play a big part in the choice of the host. Cloud based hosting is suitable if the data is not classified and the service needs to be available publicly whereas government data centres and on-premise infrastructure are best suited for handling sensitive data or if the service needs to be available internally. Hybrid solutions can also be an option. Ideally, the chosen host should support secure remote monitoring and administration so maintenance can be carried out easily.</p>
        <p>Development teams also need to consider how many deployment environments are required. For example, web services typically employ 3 distinct environments to cater for ‘development’, ’staging’ and ‘production’. It is best to keep them on the same host to reduce possible issues with compatibility.</p>
