- Put the most important information first. Many readers would not bother
  scrolling down if they do not find this information at first, so make sure
  information they must know can be found as early as possible. A good place
  to start:
  1. Features: what your product does, who the product is for
  2. If possible, what is the cost involved in usage of the product, and how
     much effort is needed in using it. For example, if the product requires
     specialised training to learn.
  3. Contact information: a form, an email etc.
- Try to avoid excessively wordy content. If possible, use pictures and videos to bring your
  point across.
