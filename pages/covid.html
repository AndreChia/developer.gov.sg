<p>
  The Government has progressively built up the digital infrastructure and
  engineering capabilities as the foundation of our Smart Nation. This has
  enabled us to respond decisively and swiftly to the COVID-19 outbreak with a
  suite of digital tools to help disseminate timely and accurate information to
  Singaporeans, and to enable our public agencies to better manage the
  crisis.

  Refer below for more details about some products we’ve developed thus far, and
  the volunteering opportunities in which you can lend a helping hand.

<h2>SafeEntry</h2>
<p>
  SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that is used to augment
  existing contact tracing efforts. It is also used for data collection through
  scanning of QR codes or scanning of NRIC at hotspots or high traffic locations
  to aggregate people counts at different premises. Data will be made
  available to the public to enable them to make informed decisions on when and
  where to visit for essentials to avoid crowding and queuing, thereby reducing
  their exposure to COVID-19.
